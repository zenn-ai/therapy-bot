Objective To explore current understanding regarding how and why people change, and the potential role of motivational interviewing in facilitating behaviour change in the general practice setting. Discussion Research into health related behaviour change highlights the importance of motivation, ambivalence and resistance. Motivational interviewing is a counselling method that involves enhancing a patient’s motivation to change by means of four guiding principles, represented by the acronym RULE: Resist the righting reflex; Understand the patient’s own motivations; Listen with empathy; and Empower the patient. Recent meta-analyses show that motivational interviewing is effective for decreasing alcohol and drug use in adults and adolescents and evidence is accumulating in others areas of health including smoking cessation, reducing sexual risk behaviours, improving adherence to treatment and medication and diabetes management. Keywordscommunication; doctor-patient relations; patient centred care; psychotherapy, brief; motivation One of the biggest challenges that primary care practitioners face is helping people change longstanding behaviours that pose significant health risks. When patients receive compelling advice to adopt a healthier lifestyle by cutting back or ceasing harmful behaviours (eg. smoking, overeating, heavy drinking) or adopting healthy or safe behaviours (eg. taking medication as prescribed, eating more fresh fruit and vegetables), it can be frustrating and bewildering when this advice is ignored or contested. A natural response for a practitioner who encounters such opposition (termed ‘resistance’ in the psychological literature) is to reiterate health advice with greater authority or to adopt a more coercive style in order to educate the patient about the imminent health risks if they don’t change. When these strategies don’t succeed, the practitioner may characterise the patient as ‘unmotivated’ or ‘lacking insight’. However, research around behaviour change shows that motivation is a dynamic state that can be influenced, and that it fluctuates in response to a practitioner’s style. Importantly, an authoritative or paternalistic therapeutic style may in fact deter change by increasing resistance. 1 The Stages of Change model and motivational interviewing Prochaska and Di Clemente 2 proposed readiness for change as a vital mediator of behavioural change. Their transtheoretical model of behaviour change (the ‘Stages of Change’) describes readiness to change as a dynamic process, in which the pros and cons of changing generates ambivalence. Ambivalence is a conflicted state where opposing attitudes or feelings coexist in an individual; they are stuck between simultaneously wanting to change and not wanting to change. Ambivalence is particularly evident in situations where there is conflict between an immediate reward and longer term adverse consequences (eg. substance abuse, weight management). For example, the patient who presents with serious health problems as a result of heavy drinking, who shows genuine concern about the impact of alcohol on his health, and in spite of advice from his practitioner to cut back his drinking, continues to drink at harmful levels, embodies this phenomenon. 660 Reprinted From Au STRAli An F Amily Phy Si Ci An Vol. 41, no. 9, Se PTembe R 2012 Motivational interviewing techniques Facilitating behaviour change in the general practice setting• stress management• completion of recommended screening or diagnostic tests or specialist/allied health/psychologist referral. The spirit of motivational interviewingmotivational interviewing is underpinned by a series of principles that emphasise a collaborative therapeutic relationship in which the autonomy of the patient is respected and the patient’s intrinsic resources for change are elicited by the therapist. Within mi, the therapist is viewed as a facilitator rather than expert, who adopts a nonconfrontational approach to guide the patient toward change. The overall spirit of mi has been described as collaborative, evocative and honouring of patient autonomy. 1 miller and Rollnick 1 have commented that the use of mi strategies in the absence of the spirit of mi is ineffective. Although paradoxical, the mi approach is effective at engaging apparently ‘unmotivated’ individuals and when considered in the context of standard practice can be a powerful engagement strategy (Case study, Table 2). The Prochaska and Di Clemente Stages of Change model 2 offers a conceptual framework for understanding the incremental processes that people pass through as they change a particular behaviour. This change process is modelled in five parts as a progression from an initial precontemplative stage, where the individual is not considering change; to a contemplative stage, where the individual is actively ambivalent about change; to preparation, where the individual begins to plan and commit to change. Successful progression through these stages leads to action, where the necessary steps to achieve change are undertaken. if successful, action leads to the final stage, maintenance, where the person works to maintain and sustain long term change. 3 Relapse is considered an important stage in the change process and is used as an opportunity to learn about sustaining maintenance in the future. motivational interviewing (mi) is an effective counselling method that enhances motivation through the resolution of ambivalence. it grew out of the Prochaska and Di Clemente model described above 2 and miller and Rollnick’s 1 work in the field of addiction medicine, which drew on the phrase ‘ready, willing and able’ to outline three critical components of motivation. These were:1• the importance of change for the patient (willingness) • the confidence to change (ability) • whether change is an immediate priority (readiness). using mi techniques, the practitioner can tailor motivational strategies to the individual’s stage of change according to the Prochaska and Di Clemente model (Table 1). 1, 2 Applications and effectiveness of motivational interviewing Recent meta-analyses show that mi is equivalent to or better than other treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy (Cb T) or pharmacotherapy, and superior to placebo and nontreatment controls for decreasing alcohol and drug use in adults 4–6 and adolescents. 7 motivational interviewing has also been shown to be efficacious in a number of other health conditions, such as smoking cessation, 8 reducing sexual risk behaviours, 9–11 improving adherence to treatment and medication, 12 as well as diabetes management. 13 in addition, studies support the applicability of mi to hi V care, such as improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy 14, 15 and the reduction of substance use among hi V positive men and women. 15 As such, mi is an important therapeutic technique that has wide applicability within healthcare settings in motivating people to change. in general practice, possible applications include: • medication adherence • management of the Sn AP (smoking, nutrition, alcohol and physical activity)16 risk factors• engagement in prevention or management programs for diabetes or cardiovascular health• management of substance abuse problems• management of problem gambling or sexual risk taking• pain management Table 1.

Building motivation to change in Phase i, four early methods represented by the acronym o ARS (Table 3) constitute the basic skills of mi. These basic counselling techniques assist in building rapport and establishing a therapeutic relationship that is consistent with the spirit of mi. Strengthening commitment to change This involves goal setting and negotiating a ‘change plan of action’. in the absence of a goal directed approach, the application of the strategies or spirit of mi can result in the maintenance of ambivalence, where patients and practitioners remain stuck. This trap can be avoided by employing strategies to elicit ‘change talk’. 1 There are many strategies to elicit ‘change talk’, but the simplest and most direct way is to elicit a patient’s intention to change by asking a series of targeted questions from the following four categories: • disadvantages of the status quo• advantages of change• optimism for change• and intention to change (Table 4). Alternatively, if a practitioner is time poor, a quick method of drawing out ‘change talk’ is to use an ‘importance ruler’. example: ‘if you can think of a scale from zero to 10 of how important it is for you to lose weight. on this scale, zero is not important at all and 10 is extremely important. Where would you be on this scale? Why are you at ____ and not zero? What would it take for you to go from ___ to (a higher number)? ’ This technique identifies the discrepancy for a patient between their current situation and where they would like to be. highlighting this discrepancy is at the core of motivating people to change. This can be followed by asking the patient to elaborate further on this discrepancy and then succinctly summarising this discrepancy and reflecting it back to the patient. next, it is important to build the Case study – using the spirit of motivational interviewing A male patient, 52 years of age, who drinks heavily and has expressed the desire to reduce drinking, but continues to drink heavily. It is easy to conclude that this patient lacks motivation, his judgment is impaired or he simply does not understand the effects of alcohol on his health. These conclusions may naturally lead the practitioner to adopt a paternalistic therapeutic style and warn the patient of the risks to his health. In subsequent consultations, when these strategies don’t work, it is easy to give up hope that he will change his drinking, characterise him as ‘unmotivated’ and drop the subject altogether. In MI, the opposite approach is taken, where the patient’s motivation is targeted by the practitioner. Using the spirit of MI, the practitioner avoids an authoritarian stance, and respects the autonomy of the patient by accepting he has the responsibility to change his drinking – or not. Motivational interviewing emphasises eliciting reasons for change from the patient, rather than advising them of the reasons why they should change their drinking. What concerns does he have about the effects of his drinking? What future goals or personal values are impacted by his drinking? The apparent ‘lack of motivation’ evident in the patient would be constructed as ‘unresolved ambivalence’ within an MI framework. The practitioner would therefore work on understanding this ambivalence, by exploring the pros and cons of continuing to drink alcohol. They would then work on resolving this ambivalence, by connecting the things the patient cares about with motivation for change. For example, drinking may impact the patient’s values about being a loving partner and father or being healthy and strong. A discussion of how continuing to drink (maintaining the status quo) will impact his future goals to travel in retirement or have a good relationship with his children may be the focus. The practitioner would emphasise that the decision to change is ‘up to him’, however they would work with the patient to increase his confidence that he can change (self efficacy). Table 2. The spirit of motivational interviewing vs an authoritative or paternalistic therapeutic style The spirit of motivational interviewing Authoritative or paternalistic therapeutic style Collaboration: a partnership between the patient and practitioner is formed. Joint decision making occurs. The practitioner acknowledges the patient’s expertise about themselves Confrontation: the practitioner assumes the patient has an impaired perspective and consequently imposes the need for ‘insight’. The practitioner tries to persuade and coerce a patient to change Evocation: the practitioner activates the patient’s own motivation for change by evoking their reasons for change. The practitioner connects health behaviour change to the things the patient cares about Education: the patient is presumed to lack the insight, knowledge or skills required to change. The practitioner tells the patient what to do Honouring a patient’s autonomy: although the practitioner informs and advises their patient, they acknowledge the patient’s right and freedom not to change. ‘It’s up to you’Authority: the practitioner instructs the patient to make changes Adapted from Miller and Rollnick, 2002662 Reprinted From Au STRAli An F Amily Phy Si Ci An Vol. 41, no. 9, Se PTembe R 2012 FOCUS Motivational interviewing techniques – facilitating behaviour change in the general practice setting• Where do we go from here? • What do you want to do at this point? • how would you like things to turn out? • After reviewing all of this, what’s the next step for you? it is common for patients to ask for answers or ‘quick fixes’ during Phase ii. in keeping with the spirit of mi, a simple phrase reminding the patient of their autonomy is useful, ‘y ou are the expert on you, so i’m not sure i am the best person to judge what will work for you. but i can give you an idea of what the evidence shows us and what other people have done in your situation’. The guiding principles of motivational interviewingin general practice, the particular difficulties associated with quick consultation times can present unique challenges in implementing mi. miller and Rollnick 17 have attempted to simplify the practice of mi for health care settings by developing four guiding principles, represented by the acronym Rule: patient’s confidence in their ability to change. This involves focusing on the patient’s strengths and past experiences of success. Again, a ‘confidence ruler’ could be employed if a practitioner is time poor. example: ‘if you can think of a scale from zero to 10 of how confident you are that you can cut back the amount you are drinking. on this scale, zero is not confident at all and 10 is extremely confident. Where would you be on this scale? Why are you at ____ and not zero? What would it take for you to go from ___ to (a higher number)? ’Finally, decide on a ‘change plan’ together. This involves standard goal setting techniques, using the spirit of mi as the guiding principle and eliciting from the patient what they plan to do (rather than instructing or advising). if a practitioner feels that the patient needs health advice at this point in order to set appropriate goals, it is customary to ask permission before giving advice as this honours the patient’s autonomy. examples of key questions to build a ‘change plan’ include:• it sounds like things can’t stay the same as they are. What do you think you might do? • What changes were you thinking about making? Table 3. OARS: The basic skills of motivational interviewing Ask Open-ended questions*• The patient does most of the talking• Gives the practitioner the opportunity to learn more about what the patient cares about (eg. their values and goals) Example I understand you have some concerns about your drinking. Can you tell me about them? Versus Are you concerned about your drinking? Make Affirmations• Can take the form of compliments or statements of appreciation and understanding • Helps build rapport and validate and support the patient during the process of change • Most effective when the patient’s strengths and efforts for change are noticed and affirmed Example I appreciate that it took a lot of courage for you to discuss your drinking with me today You appear to have a lot of resourcefulness to have coped with these difficulties for the past few years Thank you for hanging in there with me. I appreciate this is not easy for you to hear Use Reflections*• Involves rephrasing a statement to capture the implicit meaning and feeling of a patient’s statement• Encourages continual personal exploration and helps people understand their motivations more fully • Can be used to amplify or reinforce desire for change Example You enjoy the effects of alcohol in terms of how it helps you unwind after a stressful day at work and helps you interact with friends without being too self-conscious. But you are beginning to worry about the impact drinking is having on your health. In fact, until recently you weren’t too worried about how much you drank because you thought you had it under control. Then you found out your health has been affected and your partner said a few things that have made you doubt that alcohol is helping you at all Use Summarising• Links discussions and ‘checks in’ with the patient • Ensure mutual understanding of the discussion so far • Point out discrepancies between the person’s current situation and future goals• Demonstrates listening and understand the patient’s perspective Example If it is okay with you, just let me check that I understand everything that we’ve been discussing so far. You have been worrying about how much you’ve been drinking in recent months because you recognise that you have experienced some health issues associated with your alcohol intake, and you’ve had some feedback from your partner that she isn’t happy with how much you’re drinking. But the few times you’ve tried to stop drinking have not been easy, and you are worried that you can’t stop. How am I doing? * A general rule-of-thumb in MI practice is to ask an open-ended question, followed by 2–3 reflections Reprinted From Au STRAli An F Amily Phy Si Ci An Vol. 41, no. 9, Se PTembe R 2012 663 FOCUS Motivational interviewing techniques – facilitating behaviour change in the general practice setting Empower your patient Patient outcomes improve when they are an active collaborator in their treatment. 17 empowering patients involves exploring their own ideas about how they can make changes to improve their health and drawing on the patient’s personal knowledge about what has succeeded in the past. A truly collaborative therapeutic relationship is a powerful motivator. Patients benefit from this relationship the most when the practitioner also embodies hope that change is possible. Rule is a useful mnemonic to draw upon when implementing the spirit of mi in general practice. if a practitioner has more time, four additional principles (Table 5) can be applied within a longer therapeutic intervention. Barriers to implementing motivational interviewing in general practice barriers to implementing mi in general practice include time pressures, the professional development required in order to master mi, difficulty in adopting the spirit of mi when practitioners embody an expert role, patients’ overwhelming desire for ‘quick fix’ options to health issues and the brevity of consultation times. These barriers to implementing mi in primary care represent significant cons on a decisional balance. on the other hand, the pros for adopting an mi approach with patients who are resistant to change are compelling. While we are not advocating mi for all patient interactions in general practice, we invite practitioners to explore their own ambivalence toward adopting mi within their practice, and consider whether they are ‘willing, ready and able’. Practitioners who undertake mi training will have an additional therapeutic tool to draw upon when encountering patient resistance • Resist the righting reflex• understand the patient’s own motivations• listen with empathy• empower the patient. Resist the righting reflex The righting reflex describes the tendency of health professionals to advise patients about the right path for good health. This can often have a paradoxical effect in practice, inadvertently reinforcing the argument to maintain the status quo. essentially, most people resist persuasion when they are ambivalent about change and will respond by recalling their reasons for maintaining the behaviour. motivational interviewing in practice requires clinicians to suppress the initial righting reflex so that they can explore the patient’s motivations for change. Understand your patient’s motivationsit is the patient’s own reasons for change, rather than the practitioner’s, that will ultimately result in behaviour change. by approaching a patient’s interests, concerns and values with curiosity and openly exploring the patient’s motivations for change, the practitioner will begin to get a better understanding of the patient’s motivations and potential barriers to change. Listen with empathyeffective listening skills are essential to understand what will motivate the patient, as well as the pros and cons of their situation. A general rule-of-thumb in mi is that equal amounts of time in a consultation should be spent listening and talking. Table 4. Eliciting ‘change talk’1 Change talk Questions to elicit change talk Example of patient’s change talk Disadvantages of the status quo• What worries you about your blood pressure? • What difficulties have resulted from your drinking? • In what way does your weight concern you? ‘I guess, if I’m honest, if I keep drinking, I am worried my family are going to stop forgiving me for my behaviour’Advantages of change • How would you like your health to be in 5 years time? • What are the advantages of reducing your drinking? • What would be different in your life if you lost weight? ‘If I lose weight, at least I won’t have to wake up feeling guilty every morning that I am not taking care of myself’Optimism for change • When have you made a significant change in your life before? How did you do it? • What strengths do you have that would help you make a change? ‘I did stop smoking a few years ago for a year and I felt so much healthier. It was really hard, but once I put my mind to something I usually stick at it’Intention to change • In what ways do you want your life to be different in 5 years? • Forget how you would get there for a moment. If you could do anything, what would you change? ‘I never thought I would be living like this. I want to go back to being healthy and strong, with enough energy to enjoy my friends and family’. ‘I want to manage my diabetes better’Reprinted From Au STRAli An F Amily Phy Si Ci An Vol. 41, no. 9, Se PTembe R 2012 665 FOCUS Motivational interviewing techniques – facilitating behaviour change in the general practice setting References 1. miller WR, Rollnick S. motivational interviewing.

Conflict of interest: none declared. Table 5. Four further principles of motivational interviewing Express empathy In practical terms, an empathic style of communication involves the use of reflective listening skills and accurate empathy, where the practitioner seeks to understand the patient’s perspective, thoughts and feelings without judgeing, criticising or blaming. Building empathy and understanding does not mean the practitioner condones the problematic behaviour. Instead, the practitioner seeks to create an open and respectful exchange with the patient, who they approach with genuine curiosity about their experiences, feelings and values Develop discrepancy Assisting patients to identify discrepancies between their current behaviour and future goals or values about themselves as a person, partner, parent, or worker is a powerful motivator that helps ‘tip the balance’ toward change. Exploring the pros and cons of change can help a patient develop discrepancy. These ‘decisional balance’ exercises are used effectively in MI to help patients tease apart their ambivalence and help the patient express their concerns about the behaviour Roll with resistance Often when a practitioner attempts to move a patient toward change too quickly because the risks of the behaviour are significant or they perceive that there are time pressures for change, they adopt a coercive or authoritative style. If the patient is ambivalent about change, this approach will commonly be met with resistance from the patient. Resistance takes many forms but most commonly can be described as interrupting or arguing with the practitioner, discounting the practitioner’s expertise, excusing their behaviour, minimising the effects of their behaviour, blaming other people for their behaviour, being pessimistic about their chances to change or being unwilling to change altogether. In MI, rolling with this resistance involves approaching resistance without judgement and interpreting these responses as a sign that the patient holds a different perspective to the practitioner. MI then uses strategies such as simple reflection of the resistance, emphasising the individual’s choice to change or not (‘it’s up to you’), shifting the focus of the discussion or simply reframing what the person has said, in order to roll with resistance and prevent resistance from affecting engagement Support self efficacy Many people with enduring behaviours that have negative impacts on their health have made their own attempts to change at some time or other and been unsuccessful. They may have attempted to cease smoking and only lasted a week, or tried to lose weight but been unable to sustain a diet. They may have attempted to comply with their medication several times in the past but found it difficult because of side effects or a complicated dosing regimen. By highlighting the patient’s strengths and reflecting on times in their life when they have successfully changed, even if just in one small area, self efficacy can be promoted. The practitioner’s belief in a patient’s ability to change is a powerful way to promote self efficacy. By promoting self efficacy, the practitioner can help the individual develop the confidence that they are capable of change 666 Reprinted From Au STRAli An F Amily Phy Si Ci An Vol. 41, no. 9, Se PTembe R 2012"}
{"text_id": 2, "title": "Cognitive behavioural therapy: An information guide", "text": "Cognitive-behavioural therapy : an information guide 1 1 What is cognitive- behavioural therapy ? For much of the 20 th century , the dominant form of psychotherapy was psychoanalysis . This approach involved seeing a therapist sev-eral times a week , often for years . Then , in the 1970 s , an explosion of different approaches to psychotherapy began to appear . Many of these were short term , lasting only weeks or months . In 1979 , Time magazine reported that there were almost 200 dif - ferent types of psychotherapy . As of 2010 , there are thought to be between 400 and 500 types . However , when directly compared , only a handful of therapy approaches have been shown to be highly effective for the kinds of problems people usually seek help for , such as depression , anxiety , phobias and stress-related problems . Of the many therapies available , cognitive-behavioural therapy ( cbt ) is increasingly identified as the “ gold standard ” —that is , the best type of therapy for these difficulties . This conclusion is supported by more than 375 clinical trial studies since 1977 and also by current international treatment guidelines , which are based on the collective knowledge of experts in the field . For instance , the National Institute of Mental Health ( nimh ) in the United States and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( nice ) in the United Kingdom have concluded that among the available psychological 1 14/10/10 5:18 PM 2 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide treatments for anxiety and depression , cbt is recommended as the first-line psychological treatment . CBT has been shown to be effective for people of all ages , from early childhood to older adults , and for people of different levels of educa - tion and income and various cultural backgrounds . It has also been shown to be effective when used in individual or group formats . Introducing CBT CBT is an intensive , short-term ( six to 20 sessions ) , problem-oriented approach . It was designed to be quick , practical and goal-oriented and to provide people with long-term skills to keep them healthy . The focus of cbt is on the here-and-now—on the problems that come up in a person ’ s day-to-day life . cbt helps people to look at how they interpret and evaluate what is happening around them and the effects these perceptions have on their emotional experience . Childhood experiences and events , while not the focus of cbt , may also be reviewed . This review can help people to understand and address emotional upset that emerged early in life , and to learn how these experiences may influence current responses to events . According to cbt , the way people feel is linked to the way they think about a situation and not simply to the nature of the situation itself . This idea is rooted in ancient Eastern and Western philoso-phies and became part of a mainstream psychotherapy approach in the early 1960 s . Aaron T. Beck , the father of cbt , described the negative thinking patterns associated with depression ( i. e. , critical thoughts about oneself , the world and the future ) in his early writ-ings . He also outlined ways to target and reduce negative thoughts 2 14/10/10 5:18 PM 3 What is cognitive-behavioural therapy ? as a way to improve mood . In later work , Beck and his colleagues focused on the content and processes of thought related to anxi-ety and ways to treat anxiety problems . Since its creation , cbt has expanded into one of the most widely used therapeutic approaches . What happens in CBT ? In cbt , you learn to identify , question and change the thoughts , attitudes , beliefs and assumptions related to your problematic emotional and behavioural reactions to certain kinds of situations . By monitoring and recording your thoughts during situations that lead to emotional upset , you learn that the way you think can con-tribute to emotional problems such as depression and anxiety . In cbt , you learn to reduce these emotional problems by : • identifying distortions in your thinking • seeing thoughts as ideas about what is going on rather than as facts • “ standing back ” from your thinking to consider situations from different viewpoints . For cbt to be effective , you must be open and willing to discuss your thoughts , beliefs and behaviours and to participate in exer - cises during sessions . For best results , you must also be willing to do homework between sessions . 3 14/10/10 5:18 PM 4 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide What conditions can CBT treat ? CBT is an effective treatment for many psychological conditions . These include : • mood disorders , such as depression and bipolar disorder • anxiety disorders , including specific phobias ( e. g. , fear of animals , heights , enclosed spaces ) , panic disorder , social phobia ( social anxiety disorder ) , generalized anxiety disorder , obsessive-compul-sive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder • bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder • body dysmorphic disorder ( i. e. , body image ) • substance use disorders ( i. e. , smoking , alcohol and other drugs ) . CBT can also be used to help people with : • psychosis • habits such as hair pulling , skin picking and tics • sexual and relationship problems • insomnia • chronic fatigue syndrome • chronic ( persistent ) pain • long-standing interpersonal problems . A similar framework is used to treat different emotional problems in cbt ; however , the approach and strategies vary and are tailored to address each specific problem . 4 14/10/10 5:18 PM 5 What is cognitive-behavioural therapy ? Why is CBT an effective therapy ? CBT is an effective therapeutic approach because it : • is structured • is problem-focused and goal-oriented • teaches proven strategies and skills • emphasizes the importance of a good , collaborative therapeutic relationship between the therapist and client . In describing how cbt works , the focus of this guide will be on how it applies to treating people experiencing emotional distress . 5 14/10/10 5:18 PM 6 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide 2 the basics of cognitive-behavioural therapy Most often , people think of their distress as emerging directly from events and situations in their lives : “ I had an argument with my partner this morning and I am still angry , ” “ My boss criticized my work and I feel so defeated ” or “ I read the business section of the paper this morning , saw that my stock was down , and felt very anxious. ” In each example , the person highlights how the situation has caused his or her emotional upset . situation emotional reaction However , what you feel in response to a situation is determined not only by the situation , but also by the way you perceive the situ-ation or make meaning of it . This way of seeing your emotional reaction as determined by what you think about a situation is a basic assumption of the cognitive-behavioural approach . For example , if you are fast asleep at 3:00 a. m. and you are woken by a crashing sound at your bedroom window , the way you respond to the situation will differ , depending on what you think is happen-ing . If you think it is an intruder , you are likely to feel fear and ter - ror and respond by rushing out of the room to safety . If you think that it must be your roommate ( assuming you have one ) coming 6 14/10/10 5:18 PM 7 The basics of cognitive-behavioural therapy in through the window because he or she has forgotten the key ( again ! ) , you will likely feel frustration and annoyance and respond by arguing with your roommate . Finally , if you think it may be your romantic partner coming over for a late night rendezvous , you will likely feel and act with excitement . The nature of automatic thoughts In each previous example , the event is the same : a loud noise at the window at 3:00 a. m . However , you could have a different , quick thought to evaluate the situation , or what is referred to in cbt as an automatic thought—a thought that “ pops ” into your mind and shapes the particular emotion experienced ( e. g. , fear , annoyance , excitement ) and the resulting behaviour ( e. g. , escape , confronta-tion , warm greeting ) . More than the situation itself , it is these pop-up , automatic thoughts that lead to your emotional and behavioural reactions . situation automatic emotional/behavioural thoughts reactions Evaluating automatic thoughts Automatic thoughts are usually so brief and quickly overridden by your awareness of the emotions that follow from them that you may not even notice them . The ability to notice and evaluate your automatic thoughts when you are in the midst of upsetting situations is one of the core skills learned and practiced in cbt . In cbt , you learn to ask yourself , 7 14/10/10 5:18 PM 8 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide “ What was going through my mind when I noticed feeling emo- tionally upset ? ” Try this cbt exercise now : Think of a time earlier in the day or in the past couple of days when you felt some kind of emotional up-set , such as anxiety , sadness or anger . Now , try to remember what you were thinking about at the time . As you recall your thoughts during this event , you may become more aware of automatic thoughts that were going through your mind that you had not noticed at the time . Identifying your automatic thoughts helps you to clarify the nature of the resulting emotion and understand why the situation was so upsetting . Patterns in automatic thoughts When people begin to monitor and record their automatic thoughts , they often recognize a pattern . In his earliest writings on cbt in the 1960 s , Aaron T. Beck found that patients who were de-pressed often reported having automatic thoughts characterized by negative perceptions of themselves ( “ I ’ m worthless ” ) , of the world around them ( “ Nobody likes me ” ) , and of the future ( “ I ’ m hopeless and can ’ t change ” ) . This pattern of thinking was termed the “ cogni-tive triad ” of depression . Beck ’ s later writings from the 1980 s described a pattern of auto- matic thoughts that seemed to be more uniquely related to anxiety , with clients reporting more thoughts related to threat and danger ( “ What if something terrible happens ? ” ) and the inability to cope ( “ I ’ m overwhelmed , I can ’ t go on like this ” ) . 8 14/10/10 5:18 PM 9 The basics of cognitive-behavioural therapy While everyone has their own way of seeing situations and events in their lives , when people experience depression or anxiety the content of their automatic thoughts begins to take on a predictable and characteristic form . A goal of cbt is to help you become aware of your automatic thoughts and to learn to stand back and question , evaluate and correct inaccurate , negative automatic thoughts . However , cbt is not trying to teach positive thinking as a solution to life ’ s problems . Rather , the goal is for you to learn to evaluate your experiences and problems from different perspectives—positive , negative and neutral—to arrive at accurate conclusions and creative solutions to your difficulties . Identifying distortions in automatic thoughts A second feature of negative automatic thoughts in people with emotional distress is that they tend to reflect distortions or errors in thinking . For example , the person who thinks that “ I will never find a partner ” because of one unsuccessful date is catastrophizing the outcome of this date and is more likely to experience excessive emotional upset than the person who thinks “ This date didn ’ t go well but hopefully things will go better next time. ” In another ex-ample , a student who concludes that a low mark on a recent exam means that he is “ stupid ” and a “ failure ” is labelling himself and thinking in all-or-nothing terms , and is more likely to be distressed than a student who thinks , “ I didn ’ t do as well as I would have liked but I ’ ll seek out extra help and study harder next time. ” Distortions in thinking exaggerate the emotional significance of common , everyday events . One aim of cbt is to help you become 9 14/10/10 5:18 PM 10 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide more aware of distortions in your perception of day-to-day experi- ences , especially when you are very upset . Everyone has negative automatic thoughts that pop up in the flow of consciousness , and most of us have cognitive distortions from time to time . However , some people are more likely to have auto-matic thoughts related to depression and anxiety , and to have more cognitive distortions . The cbt approach suggests that automatic thoughts are influenced by two “ deeper ” levels of thinking , which can make people more vulnerable to having recurrent negative and distorted thinking patterns . These deeper levels are known as rules and assumptions and core beliefs . Rules and assumptions From early childhood , you learn certain rules and assumptions through your interactions with family members and the world around you . For instance , you may learn rules about : • how to relate with others ( e. g. , “ If you don ’ t have anything nice to say , then don ’ t say anything at all ” ) • the acceptability of expressing emotions ( e. g. , “ Don ’ t ever let them see you sweat ” ) • your performance ( e. g. , “ If you can ’ t do something perfectly , then it ’ s not even worth trying ” or “ I should be great at everything I do ” ) . These rules and assumptions may not be obvious to you and re-main out of your awareness . However , when you begin to monitor your automatic thoughts in upsetting situations , you become aware of patterns in your automatic thoughts that are linked to your un-derlying rules and assumptions . 10 14/10/10 5:18 PM 11 The basics of cognitive-behavioural therapy For example , if you hold an underlying assumption that you must be the best at everything you do , you are more likely to be distressed by a less than optimal outcome ( e. g. , failed test , lost promotion , unsuccessful job interview ) than someone who does not hold this assumption . Automatic thoughts can arise from underlying rules and assumptions . situation automatic emotional/behavioural thoughts reactions assumptions/rules CBT aims to help you become more aware of your own rules and assumptions and how these contribute to a pattern of negative automatic thoughts in emotionally upsetting situations . Core beliefs At the deepest level of cognition , even deeper than your rules and assumptions , are your core beliefs . Core beliefs usually develop early in life . They reflect rigid and absolute notions about yourself , others and the world . Examples of positive core beliefs are “ I ’ m attractive , ” “ I ’ m smart ” and “ I ’ m loveable. ” Examples of negative core beliefs are “ I ’ m worthless ” or “ I ’ m weak ” ; “ others are danger - ous ” and “ not to be trusted ” ; and “ the world is a scary place ” and “ overwhelming. ” Aaron T. Beck suggested that people with negative core beliefs are more at risk of developing depression or anxiety than people with positive core beliefs . Negative core beliefs may be inactive and not affect a person ’ s life until a stressful life event , such as a death in the family , a break-up or job loss activates these beliefs . For example , 11 14/10/10 5:18 PM 12 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide a woman who has a core belief that she is “ unlovable ” may also believe that if she works hard to please her partner , he may love her anyway . However , if her partner breaks up with her , her core belief of being “ unlovable ” may be reactivated , and increase her vulner - ability to depression or anxiety . situation automatic emotional/behavioural thoughts reactions assumptions/rules core beliefs A basic assumption of cbt is that people can learn to identify , evaluate and change their assumptions and core beliefs , just as they are able to identify and change their negative automatic thoughts . When you begin to reduce negative assumptions and beliefs , you also begin to have fewer negative and distorted auto-matic thoughts . Reducing the negative underlying assumptions and core beliefs that give rise to your emotional problems lessens your emotional upset and also offers you some protection from becoming depressed and anxious again . In summary , cbt is different from many other therapeutic approach - es because it focuses on helping you learn to identify the relation- ship between your thoughts , feelings and behaviours . While each of these are interdependent ( they all serve to influence each other ) , cbt gives special attention to the role of cognition ( automatic thoughts , rules and assumptions and core beliefs ) in creating and maintaining emotional difficulties such as depression and anxiety . CBT aims to help you identify , evaluate and change your habitual thinking patterns at each of these levels of cognition . Working with the therapist , you learn that assigning less extreme , more helpful 12 14/10/10 5:18 PM 13 The basics of cognitive-behavioural therapy and more accurate meanings to negative events leads to less extreme and less disturbing emotional and behavioural responses . Once you have learned these skills in therapy , you will become your own therapist , with the ability to manage difficult experiences and emotional upset on your own . 13 14/10/10 5:18 PM 14 3 CBt approaches to cognitive change Automatic thoughts pop up all the time in everyone ’ s minds . Some of these thoughts are positive , some are neutral and some are neg-ative . The ones that are of particular interest in cbt are the negative automatic thoughts that relate to periods of intense moods . An early aim of cbt is to help you learn to identify negative automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions in problematic situations . This skill can be learned relatively quickly by some people , while for oth-ers it will take practice and require patience . Identifying relations between thoughts , moods and behaviours The first step toward identifying automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions in problematic situations is for you to discuss recent upsetting situations with your cbt therapist . This discussion helps you to learn about the relationship between your thoughts , moods and behaviours , as in the following example : Therapist : Can you think of a situation in the past week when you felt upset ? 14 14/10/10 5:18 PM 15 CBT approaches to cognitive change Peter : I was sitting on the subway and noticing all of the couples together . Therapist : And what feelings came up for you as you were notic- ing the couples ? Peter : I was feeling sad and angry. Therapist : And what were you thinking about as you were feeling sad and angry ? Peter : I was thinking everyone seems to have someone in their life but me , and it ’ s just not fair . Therapist : And if it ’ s true that everyone seems to have someone but you , do you think this says something about you ? Peter : Yah , that I ’ m a loser and will always be alone. Therapist : And what did you do when you were thinking and feeling this way ? Peter : After a while I couldn ’ t take it anymore so I got off the subway even though I hadn ’ t reached my stop yet . I went home and just sat on my bed thinking about all of this . In this example , the following elements are identified : Situation : On the subway , noticing couples Moods : Sad and angry Thoughts : Everyone has someone but me , it isn ’ t fair , I ’ m a loser , I will be alone forever. Behaviours : Escape from subway , return home to ruminate 15 14/10/10 5:18 PM 16 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide This example shows that to understand why Peter was feeling sad and angry , we need to understand what he was thinking : • that he does not have a relationship and really wants to be in one • that it does not seem fair to him that everyone else seems to get what he desires so much in his life • that because he does not have someone now , he will never find someone and will always be alone . As an exercise , try to think of a situation in the past week that was up - setting . Please take a moment to see if you can identify the following : Situation : ( Where were you ? Were you with anyone ? ) Moods : ( What were you feeling ? ) Thoughts : ( What was going through your mind ? ) Behaviours : ( What did you do ? How did you cope ? ) Questioning and evaluating negative automatic thoughts As you learn to identify your negative automatic thoughts , you will also learn to question and evaluate these thoughts . A main goal of cbt is to help you learn to see your thoughts as ideas that do not necessarily reflect reality . In other words , just because you think something does not always mean it is true . 16 14/10/10 5:18 PM 17 CBT approaches to cognitive change To help you move toward this goal , the therapist will direct you through “ cognitive restructuring ” exercises . In these exercises , you will learn to stand back and question your negative automatic thoughts and to evaluate the evidence that either supports or does not support the thoughts . You will then be able to draw conclu-sions about the accuracy of your thoughts . A cbt therapist working with Peter in the previous example might ask him the following questions : • “ Do you know anyone that you like and respect who is not cur - rently in a relationship ? ” • “ Do you have any past experiences in romantic relationships ? ” • “ If you had a good friend that had the same thoughts about him- self or herself , what would you say to that friend ? ” • “ Are you possibly discounting any life experiences to suggest that you will not be completely alone ? ” • “ Are you potentially blaming yourself for something that you do not have complete control of ? ” The goal here is not to challenge Peter ’ s thinking but rather to move him to a questioning mode and to consider the accuracy of his automatic thoughts based on evidence from his life . Identifying and correcting cognitive distortions Identifying and changing negative automatic thoughts related to strong feelings also involves learning to identify distortions or “ errors ” in thinking as you experience or recall upsetting situations . 17 14/10/10 5:18 PM 18 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide Distortions in thinking are more likely to occur when you feel dis- tressed . This is because emotional distress can wear you down , and feeling worn down tends to make people more reliant on shortcuts or more simplistic ways of thinking . Everyone has distortions in thinking at times . Below are some types of distortions in thinking ( Burns , 1999 ) , with examples to illustrate what they look like : • All-or-nothing ( black-and-white ) thinking : When you see things as either black or white with no grey area in between ( e. g. , Amina finished the term with three A+s , two As and one B+ and is think-ing that because she did not ace all her courses she is a “ failure ” ) . • Disqualifying the positive : When you discount positive experiences and continue to focus only on the negative ( e. g. , Josh is a devoted father who helps his son with homework every night and spends as much time with him as possible on the weekends . Recent business travel has kept him away from home more than usual , leading him to conclude that he is a “ lousy father ” ) . • Overgeneralization : When you see a single event as something that will never end ( e. g. , Ingrid felt anxious in the meeting at work and now concludes that she will never be able to interact with her colleagues comfortably ) . • Mental filter : When you pay attention to a small negative detail in an experience so that it takes on great importance ( e. g. , Dwight is speaking to a group of 10 youth at his church and continually focuses his attention on one person who seems disinterested in what he has to say rather than the other nine who seem quite engaged ) . • Catastrophizing : When you think of the worst case scenario—that is , you assume that a situation will be more awful or horrible than it is likely to be ( e. g. , Susan awakes one morning and notices a rash on the back of her leg . Rather than thinking of all the factors that could have contributed to the rash , she quickly concludes that she has skin cancer and rushes to the doctor ) . 18 14/10/10 5:18 PM 19 CBT approaches to cognitive change • Mind reading : When you jump to conclusions thinking that some- one is thinking of you negatively before you have all of the facts ( e. g. , Guy walks into a movie theatre and as he goes to sit down , he trips and stumbles and spills his popcorn and drink . He thinks that everyone must be thinking that “ he ’ s a total loser ” ) . • Personalization : When you see events not going well as a result of something about you ( e. g. , Charmaine is hosting a party and sees that two guests are sitting quietly on their own . She begins to think it must be her fault that they are not having a good time ) . Recording your thoughts Early in treatment , the cbt therapist will question you in ways that help you to identify and question your negative automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions . As you progress , the therapist will ask you to use the thought record between sessions as homework . With practice , you will become skilled at using the thought record to re-cord , question and evaluate your automatic thoughts and to reduce emotional distress in your day-to-day life . The best time to do the thought record is soon after the situation or event that causes distress . This is when you are most aware of the thoughts related to your experience . However , sometimes this is difficult ; for instance , if the problem comes up at work or at other times where it would be inconvenient or where your privacy would be compromised . When this is the case , try to find a time later the same day to record the details , before they fade , and to help you feel better about the situation sooner , rather than later . The first three columns of the thought record ( shown in Table 1 ) are used to record the situation that you were in when you began to experience a strong emotion , the automatic thoughts related to the event or experience , and the strength of your emotional reaction . 19 14/10/10 5:18 PM 20 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide The example in Table 1 shows how a client named Nancy reported on the experience of anxiety when thinking about an upcoming event : table 1. the thought record : example situation automatic thoughtsemotions thinking about driving up north to the cottage I am going to have a panic attack while driving everyone will be angry with me I won ’ t be able to cope with the situation Fear ( 80 % ) Once Nancy listed her automatic thoughts , the next step was for her to consider the evidence that supported and did not support her thoughts and to evaluate their accuracy , as shown in Table 2. table 2. e valuating the evidence evidence for : evidence against : Felt nervous on the drive up north last time . even though I felt nervous , I did not have a full-fledged panic attack . People did seem somewhat put off by the fact that I spent my night resting in my room after the drive last time. even though I was uncomfortable , I was still able to drive and I got us there safely . 20 14/10/10 5:18 PM 21 CBT approaches to cognitive change evidence for : evidence against : My boyfriend will be driving with me and he is very understanding and supportive and won ’ t get angry with me . I have travelled five other times this year without any anxiety at all . even if I do get very anxious and have a panic attack , I know that it is not dangerous to me . I will cope by trying not to catastrophize the anxiety . By evaluating the evidence supporting or not supporting the negative automatic thoughts , both through discussion with her therapist and through the use of the thought record , Nancy was able to arrive at a more balanced alternative appraisal of the situation . As is often the case for everyone , just a little bit of new information led Nancy to a different and less upsetting interpretation of the situation . Targeting assumptions and beliefs As therapy progresses , the cbt therapist will introduce other cogni - tive strategies and homework worksheets to target your underlying assumptions and core beliefs . One way to identify your core beliefs and assumptions is to use your thought records to identify specific situations that lead to emotional distress , and to look for themes that recur . The cbt therapist can then help you to question and evaluate these assumptions and beliefs and to generate less distressing , alternative viewpoints as they occur in upsetting situations . 21 14/10/10 5:18 PM 22 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide Another way assumptions and beliefs are targeted for change in cbt is to write down a negative core belief on one side of the page , for example , “ unlikeable ” and an alternative , less distressing belief that you would prefer to hold about yourself , for example , “ likeable ” on the other side of the page . You would then be asked to keep track of your experiences over the week , noting instances where the negative or positive belief seemed to be supported . In situations where you collected evidence to support the negative belief , you would also be asked to review the situation carefully for supporting and contrary evidence to arrive at a more balanced perspective . Beh A v Iou RAl ex Pe RIMents A powerful tool for questioning and evaluating underlying assumptions and core beliefs is to test their validity with behav-ioural experiments . For instance , if you had an underlying assumption that “ If I make a mistake everyone will laugh and ridicule me , ” you might be asked to perform an experiment to determine what actually happens when mistakes are made . Of course , you will only conduct experiments that you think you are ready for , and after you have developed strategies to cope with the full range of possible outcomes from these types of experiments . When you are ready , you may , for example , be asked to make a mis- take on purpose , such as to go into a store and drop change while in line , or to spill a drink in a cafeteria . This will allow you to see the extent to which : a ) people notice , b ) people respond ( e. g. , do others laugh and ridicule you as feared or alternatively , do people not seem to notice or criticize you ) , and c ) how well you can cope with the situation . 22 14/10/10 5:18 PM 23 CBT approaches to cognitive change In summary , the initial focus of cbt is to help you identify and change negative automatic thoughts that lead to emotional distress in problematic situations . You learn skills to identify and correct negative automatic thoughts and the cognitive distortions that fuel strong moods . The main tool for cognitive change is the thought record . Other cognitive strategies are used to consolidate progress with changing negative automatic thoughts and the deeper assump - tions and beliefs . These include : • examining the advantages and disadvantages of holding such beliefs • examining the evidence that supports and does not support the assumptions and beliefs • trying to find less extreme , more middle-ground views of oneself , others and the world • performing behavioural experiments . 23 14/10/10 5:18 PM 24 4 CBt approaches to behavioural change So far , we have focused on the “ C ” of cbt , which refers to changing the cognitive aspects , or thinking , that can lead to emotional dis-tress . We now move on to the “ B ” in cbt , which refers to changing the behaviours that can worsen and prolong negative moods . Changes in thinking and behaviours go hand in hand : When you change the way you think about a situation or problem , your behav-iours may also change . The reverse is also true : When you change how you approach a situation or problem , you may come to think differently about it . For instance , if you smoke , and some new information leads you to believe that smoking is more dangerous to your health than you once thought , this may lead you to quit smoking ( i. e. , cognitive change leads to behavioural change ) . Or , to turn it around , if you go for a week without smoking because you are sick or unable to smoke , it could lead you to think , “ If I can go a week without smoking , maybe I could go a month. ” This think-ing could lead to a new behavioural goal of trying to quit smoking for a month ( i. e. , behavioural change leads to cognitive change ) . CBT uses a variety of behavioural methods and strategies to reduce your distress , which are introduced on the following pages . 24 14/10/10 5:18 PM 25 CBT approaches to behavioural change Self-monitoring Chapter 3 outlined the use of thought records to identify and evalu- ate negative thoughts and cognitive distortions . Thought records are one type of self-monitoring strategy that you will be asked to do in cbt . You may also be asked to do other forms of self monitoring , such as : • monitoring your moods or feelings of pleasure or mastery day by day , perhaps rating them on a scale from zero to 10 or zero to 100 • monitoring symptoms of your problem in specific situations • scheduling activities or monitoring your progress with a behav-ioural goal ; for instance , planning or recording how many times you exercised at the gym in the past week . sel F-Mon Ito RIng DAY BY DAY By keeping track of problems as they occur day by day , people become more aware of the specific situations that tend to “ activate ” their distress . The monitoring forms used in cbt help people be-come more tuned in to the particular type of reactions they have to difficult situations . For instance , do certain events tend to activate feelings such as sadness , anxiety , anger , hurt or disappointment ? Monitoring forms are also used to help people become more aware of the intensity of their moods . For instance , does one situation often lead to low levels of anxiety , while another situation always leads to extremely high levels of anxiety ? Finally , monitoring forms are not just used to track problems ; they are also used to help people become more aware of how well they are doing . For instance , monitoring forms can be used to rate the degree of success people have achieved toward reaching 25 14/10/10 5:18 PM 26 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide a behavioural goal , or to track their experience of pleasure or mastery ( i. e. , achievement and skill ) during certain events and tasks . People with depression and other emotional problems that affect motivation tend to become less involved or engaged in activities . When they do engage in an activity , they tend to report less enjoy-ment than they actually felt at the time they were doing the activity . One way for people to get a better idea of how they spend their days and how much pleasure and sense of mastery they derive from each activity is to keep track of what they do and how they felt at the time . If you have problems with motivation , keeping track of your activities can help you recognize that you can get more pleasure and mastery from doing things than from not doing them . In simple terms , doing things , even small things , can help you to feel better . An activity schedule lists the days of the week across the top and the hours of the day down the left side . Your therapist may ask you to record your activities hour to hour and to make pleasure and mastery ratings on a scale from zero to 10 , as seen in the example of a partially completed schedule in Table 3 below . table 3 . Weekly activity schedule with pleasure ratings monday tuesday wednesday 7–8 a. m. got up , had coffee P ( pleasure ) 2 ; M ( mastery ) 0 got up , read the paper and made breakfast P 4 ; M 4 got up , talked to friend overseas P 6 ; M 0 8–9 a. m. took the dog for a walk P 3 ; M 3 took the dog for a walk P 2 ; M 3 took the dog for a quick walk , rushed to class P 1 ; M 5 26 14/10/10 5:18 PM 27 CBT approaches to behavioural change 9–10 a. m. took bus to class P 0 ; M 4 Met study group to work on presentation P 2 ; M 8 Attended class P 5 ; M 6 10–11 a. m.

The process of closely monitoring and recording your experiences can in itself improve your mood and well-being , and so this is usually encouraged following the first cbt session . If you are seeking help for anxiety , you may be asked to complete monitoring forms to record the precise symptoms of anxiety depending on the particular anxiety problem you are experiencing . For example , if you are seeking help for social anxiety , you will be asked to complete a monitoring form that will ask you to record social or performance situations in the past where you felt anxious . 27 14/10/10 5:18 PM 28 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide If you are seeking help for obsessive-compulsive disorder , you will record the nature and distress associated with obsessive thoughts throughout the week as well as the frequency and duration of com-pulsive rituals . Table 4 provides an example of a symptom monitoring form that is tailored for panic attacks . This form allows you to record all of the symptoms experienced during a panic attack over the week between sessions . table 4 . Panic attack monitoring form situation : Rate anxiety severity : symptoms ( tick all experienced ) : q Accelerated heart rate q Chest pain or discomfort q Dizziness q Paresthesia ( numbness ) q trembling or shaking q sensation of shortness of breath q Blushing q sweating q nausea / growling stomach q Muscle tension q Dry mouth q Inability to relax q Restlessness q Fatigue q Discomfort q sleep difficulties q Irritability or anger outbursts q Difficulty concentrating q hypervigilance for danger q exaggerated startle response none Moderate Intense 0 5 10 28 14/10/10 5:18 PM 29 CBT approaches to behavioural change s Che Dul Ing ACt Iv It Ies The same schedule used in Table 3 to monitor activities and make pleasure and mastery ratings may also be used to help you sched-ule . One use is to schedule activities that you may have been avoid-ing . This can help to remove indecisiveness around whether or not you should do an activity . For instance , if you decide in advance that you will go to the gym between 5:00 p. m. and 6:00 pm on Tuesday , you are more likely to go than if you wait to decide based on how you feel that day . The therapist may also ask you to schedule both pleasurable activities ( e. g. , lunch with a friend ) and mastery tasks ( e. g. , organizing and paying bills ) for the upcoming week . You will likely also be asked to keep track of your automatic thoughts during your weekly activities to help you identify distortions or other appraisals that minimize or undermine your pleasure or sense of mastery in the activity . A further use of the activity schedule is to help you recognize the barriers to completing tasks and to break down these tasks into smaller units to make the tasks less distressing and more likely to be accomplished . “ Graded tasks ” can then be constructed where you schedule the easier steps of the task before getting to more complicated and challenging parts of the task . Simply changing the structure and the approach to tasks in this way can create remark-able changes in the likelihood that you will accomplish tasks . Exposure therapy A standard component of cbt treatment for anxiety is exposure therapy . Exposure therapy works to reduce your fear of certain things ( e. g. , insects , snakes ) or situations ( e. g. , closed spaces , heights ) by gradually increasing your exposure to the feared thing 29 14/10/10 5:18 PM 30 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide or situation . To begin , you may be asked to imagine or look at pic- tures of that feared thing or situation ( indirect exposure ) and then gradually increase your exposure until you are able to touch the thing or experience the situation ( direct exposure ) . With gradual exposure to your fears , your anxiety decreases and you learn that your fears are excessive and irrational . This process is called habituation . Figure 1 shows that as the number of expo-sures to the feared thing or situation increases , the level of anxiety produced by exposure decreases . Figure 1. habituation curve in exposure therapy Exposure therapy usually starts with exposure to situations that create only mild-to-moderate fear and gradually progress to situa-tions that create higher levels of anxiety . Before starting exposure therapy , you will complete a hierarchy of your fears , listing all of the situations that trigger your anxiety and the different levels of anxiety associated with each trigger . In the example of a completed hierarchy of fear in Table 5 , a person who fears coming into contact Exposur e 5-8 Exposur e 3-5 Exposur e 1-2 Anxiety Time 30 14/10/10 5:18 PM 31 CBT approaches to behavioural change with beetles rates situations involving beetles—from mildly dis- tressing to most distressing . table 5. hierarchy of feared situations : example FEARED SITUATION ( mildly distressing to most distressing ) DISTRESS ( 10–100 ) view cartoon drawing of beetles , then touch it 10 view photo of real beetles , then touch it 20 stand in room with small beetles , walk within five feet of beetles 30 Walk within one foot of small beetles 40 stand in room with large beetles , walk within five feet of beetles 50 Walk within one foot of large beetles 60 touch small beetles with finger 70 Allow small beetles to crawl on arm 80 touch large beetles with finger 90 Allow large beetles to crawl on arm 100 At first you will complete exposure tasks with the help of the therapist . Later , as you progress , you will be asked to do them on your own as homework between sessions . The rate at which you progress in treatment will depend on the severity of your fear and on your ability to tolerate the discomfort associated with arousing your anxiety . Exposure tasks need to be repeated and last long enough ( usually not less than 30 minutes ) to result in optimal improvements . You learn that anxiety comes down naturally when you remain in the fear-provoking situation long enough . 31 14/10/10 5:18 PM 32 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide Behavioural experiments Behavioural experiments were described on page 22 as a way of testing your underlying assumptions and beliefs . Behavioural experiments ask you to act out a feared situation to see if what you fear might happen does happen . Should the feared outcome occur , the experiments will also enable you to see how well you cope with the situation . These tasks are behavioural because they require that you “ test out ” new ways of thinking by doing something differently , often by go-ing into situations and choosing a different behavioural strategy . 32 14/10/10 5:18 PM 33 5 CBt in practice : Questions and answers Answers to frequently asked questions about cbt , such as how to find a therapist and what to expect in treatment , are outlined below . How will I know if CBT is for me ? Most people know within the first few sessions if they are comfort-able with cbt and whether it is meeting their treatment needs . The therapist will also check to see that cbt is the right “ fit ” for you . When the fit is not quite right , the therapist may adjust the treatment or suggest other treatment options . However , in general , cbt may be a good therapy option for you if : • you are interested in learning practical skills to manage your present , day-to-day life and associated emotional difficulties • you are willing and interested in practising change strategies ( “ homework ” ) between sessions to consolidate improvement . CBT may not be for you if you want to focus exclusively on past is-sues , if you want supportive counselling , or if you are not willing to do homework between sessions . 33 14/10/10 5:18 PM 34 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide How can I find a qualified CBT therapist in my area ? To find the contact information for certified cbt therapists in Canada and the United States , consult the following resources : • Academy of Cognitive Therapies www. academyofct. org • Association for Behaviour and Cognitive Therapies www. abct. org What can I expect on my first visit with a CBT therapist ? At your first visit , you and the cbt therapist will discuss : • the nature and causes of your difficulties and factors that could be maintaining them • how the therapist will apply the cbt model to your specific problems • how the tasks that you will do in therapy can work to change dif - ferent aspects of the problems • what you want to get out of treatment • whether cbt is a suitable treatment approach for you • whether other treatment approaches might be called for , either instead of or in addition to cbt . By the end of this first visit , you and the therapist will have devel-oped a goal-oriented treatment plan to address your difficulties . 34 14/10/10 5:18 PM 35 CBT in practice : Questions and answers What happens in a CBT session ? CBT sessions can be given to clients individually or in groups . Both formats follow the same predictable structure , as follows : • Mood check : The therapist asks about your mood since the previous session . This may include the use of scales to assess depression , anxiety or other emotional problems . The purpose of the mood check is to see if your mood improves from session to session . • Bridge : The focus of the previous session is reviewed to create a bridge to the current session . • Agenda : The therapist and client identify issues to address in the current session that will act as the agenda . • Homework review : Homework from the previous session is re-viewed to note progress and troubleshoot any difficulties that may have emerged . • Agenda items : Agenda issues are addressed using cognitive and behavioural strategies . • New homework : Exercises and tasks for the upcoming week are assigned . • Summary and client feedback : Wrap up of the session . How can I get the most out of CBT between sessions ? CBT is a treatment approach that teaches you skills to become your own therapist over time . You learn new skills in the therapy ses-sions , but ultimately much of the change occurs between therapy sessions when practising the skills in your own environment as part of homework . Early in treatment , the cbt therapist will suggest 35 14/10/10 5:18 PM 36 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide homework , such as monitoring thoughts and behaviours , taking steps to reduce avoidance behaviour , conducting experiments to test out predictions and completing worksheets to challenge nega-tive thoughts or beliefs . As treatment progresses , you will learn to set your own homework between sessions to help you accomplish your treatment goals . Research demonstrates that the more you successfully practise the skills of cbt in your homework , the better the treatment outcome . How long does CBT last ? CBT is a time-limited , focused treatment approach . For problems such as anxiety and depression , cbt usually involves 12 to 20 ses-sions . However , the length of treatment can vary , depending on the severity and complexity of your problems—some clients improve significantly in four to six sessions , while others may need more than 20 sessions . Hospital-based programs targeting specific prob-lems are usually 12 to 15 sessions . How frequent are the sessions ? CBT usually starts out with weekly sessions . As treatment pro-gresses , sessions may be spaced further apart , such as every two weeks or month . Once people have finished a course of cbt , it is common for them to return for occasional “ booster ” sessions to keep up their progress , deal with any setbacks and prevent relapse of problems . Again , hospital-based programs are typically pre-set ( e. g. , a group meeting weekly at the same time for 12 weeks ) and are less flexible in terms of scheduling and spacing sessions than community-based cbt therapists . 36 14/10/10 5:18 PM 37 CBT in practice : Questions and answers Do I need to prepare for CBT sessions ? Preparing to discuss a specific problem at each session helps you to get the most out of cbt . Coming prepared helps to keep you fo-cused on your goals for therapy . It also helps to build a therapeutic relationship between you and your therapist and to communicate well throughout the session . Will the CBT therapist be able to understand and appreciate my own unique background ? Research on cbt demonstrates that it is an effective treatment regardless of gender , race , ethnicity , culture , sexual orientation or social economic status . cbt therapists are trained to recognize the importance of cultural values and to adapt their treatments to meet culturally unique needs . They are trained , for example , to : • be aware of their own personal values and biases and how these may influence their relationship with the client • use skills and intervention strategies that are culturally appropri-ate for the person being seen • be aware of how certain cultural processes may influence the relationship between the therapist and client . As a client in cbt you should feel that you can openly discuss aspects of your culture or sexual orientation , for example , and that your treatment will be delivered in a manner that is consistent with these values . 37 14/10/10 5:18 PM 38 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide Is CBT an effective treatment for children and adolescents ? CBT has been adapted for use with children and has been shown in research to be an effective intervention for a variety of clinical problems that can emerge in childhood , including anxiety and depression . The content and pacing of the therapy is adjusted to be appropriate for the child ’ s level of development . Often , the cbt therapist will work with the parent and child—the younger the child , the more involved the parent will be in learning and deliver - ing cbt strategies for their child ’ s problem . What are the common barriers that come up in CBT ? Barriers to treatment can include : • perceived stigma associated with mental health treatment • difficulty identifying and distinguishing emotions and their intensity • difficulty in reflecting on thoughts • difficulty tolerating heightened emotions • not completing homework • financial constraints • chronic conditions and multiple difficulties • low optimism toward improving • avoiding treatment sessions . The therapist will work with you to reduce these barriers and will also offer strategies that you can use to overcome barriers . 38 14/10/10 5:18 PM 39 CBT in practice : Questions and answers Should I start treatment with medications or CBT or both in combination ? Many people who seek treatment for emotional difficulties in Canada are first treated by their family doctor with one or more medications ( e. g. , antidepressants ) before cbt is considered . Not much research has been done to show whether it is best to start treatment with medication or cbt or both . However , research has shown that cbt , with or without certain types of medications , is equally effective for the treatment of anxiety problems , and that cbt and medications together are best for treating severe depres-sion and psychosis . Importantly , taking these kinds of medications has not been shown to interfere with cbt , and in some instances may help people to get more out of the therapy . There is , however , one class of medication commonly prescribed to people with anxiety problems , known as benzodiazepines , which can potentially limit the benefits of cbt . Medications in this class include clonazepam ( Rivotril ) , alprazolam ( Xanax ) and lorazepam ( Ativan ) . While these medications can rapidly relieve and control anxiety in the short term , they can also make it harder to learn new things , which is essential to benefit from cbt and reduce anxiety in the long run . If you are taking these medications and are about to start cbt , your cbt therapist will want to review the advantages and disadvantages of continuing with these medications during cbt treatment . When considering or starting cbt , discuss all of your questions or concerns about your medications with your cbt therapist and/or your prescribing medical doctor . Medications can be monitored and discussed throughout treatment and adjusted depending on 39 14/10/10 5:18 PM 40 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide your progress in cbt . Note that recommendations or changes to your medication can only be made by your prescribing doctor . If your cbt therapist is not a doctor , he or she can—with your per - mission—communicate with your doctor to help ensure that you receive the optimal combination of treatments . How can I stay well after finishing CBT ? A major goal of cbt is for you to become your own therapist and to continue to practise cbt skills even after you are feeling better . You may also wish to return for follow-up or “ booster ” sessions from time to time . A key component of cbt treatment is teaching relapse prevention strategies . This includes helping you learn to identify the triggers and early signs of relapse and to develop an action plan to prevent downward spirals of negative emotions . 40 14/10/10 5:18 PM Cognitive-behavioural therapy : an information guide 41 6 Alternative cognitive- behavioural approaches Of the hundreds of psychological treatments available , several are closely related to cbt , but have distinct approaches . Although the effectiveness of these alternative cbt approaches is not as well proven as the mainstream approach described so far in this guide , the four introduced on the following pages have been found to be effective in helping people with certain types of problems . Overall , they all share a common goal of helping people learn how to “ let go ” of focusing on and reacting to their thoughts . Mindfulness therapy and mindfulness- based cognitive therapy Mindfulness techniques can be used to help people distance them- selves from their negative thinking and recognize that thoughts do not have to determine behaviours . Mindfulness is a state of aware-ness , openness and receptiveness that allows people to engage fully in what they are doing at any given moment . Mindfulness skills are mainly taught through meditation ; however , other experiential exercises ( e. g. , walking or eating with awareness ) can also be used to teach these skills . 41 14/10/10 5:18 PM 42 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide Mindfulness skills can be broken down into three categories : • Defusion : distancing oneself from and letting go of unhelpful thoughts , beliefs and memories . • Acceptance : accepting thoughts and feelings without judgment , simply allowing them to come and go rather than trying to push them out of awareness or make sense of them . • Contact in the present moment : engaging fully in the here-and-now with an attitude of openness and curiosity . Mindfulness skills promote freedom from the tendency to get drawn into automatic negative reactions to thoughts and feelings . Mindfulness techniques have been used in the treatment of chronic pain , hypertension , heart disease , cancer , gastrointestinal disorders , eating disorders , anxiety disorders and substance use disorders . Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy has been found to be effective in reducing relapse to depression . Acceptance and commitment therapy While some therapies attempt to change upsetting thoughts and feelings , acceptance and commitment therapy ( act ) helps people to simply notice and accept thoughts and feelings in the present moment . ACT views psychological suffering as being caused by avoiding or evaluating thoughts and feelings , which in turn can lead to ways of thinking that interfere with our ability to act consistently with important personal values . The focus of act is on helping people accept what is out of their personal control while committing to doing what is within their control to improve their quality of life . 42 14/10/10 5:18 PM 43 Alternative cognitive-behavioural approaches ACT aims to help people handle the pain and stress that life inevi- tably brings and to create a rich , full and meaningful life . People learn how to deal with painful thoughts and feelings in ways that have less impact and influence over their lives . For example , they learn to : • distance themselves from upsetting thoughts ( cognitive defusion ) • accept experiences in the present moment • discover important and meaningful personal values • set goals consistent with these values • commit to take action . ACT has been found to be effective in treating depression , anxiety , stress , chronic pain and substance use disorders . Dialectical behavioural therapy Dialectical behavioural therapy ( dbt ) is an effective treatment for people with excessive mood swings , self-harming behaviour and other interpersonal problems related to the expression of anger . DBT has an individual and a group component . In individual therapy , the therapist and client follow a treatment target hierarchy to guide their discussion of issues that come up between weekly sessions . First priority is given to self-harming and suicidal behaviours , then to behaviours that interfere with therapy , and next to improving the client ’ s quality of life . The quality-of-life improvement part of the therapy involves identifying skills that the person has but is not using to full advantage , to teaching new skills , and to discussing obstacles for using those skills . Weekly group therapy focuses on acquiring new skills . 43 14/10/10 5:18 PM 44 Cognitive-behavioural therapy : An information guide Clients keep diary cards to help monitor their use of the skills and have access to 24-hour phone consultation with their therapist . The four modules of dbt are core mindfulness , emotion regulation ( e. g. , identifying and labelling emotions and reducing vulnerability to negative emotions ) , interpersonal effectiveness ( e. g. , assertive-ness skills ) and distress tolerance skills ( e. g. , crisis survival skills such as distracting , self-soothing and improving the moment ) . Meta-cognitive therapy Meta-cognitive therapy ( mct ) was first developed to treat general-ized anxiety disorder and is now also used to treat other anxiety disorders and depression . Metacognition is the aspect of cognition that controls mental processes and thinking . Most people have some direct conscious experience of metacognition . For example , when a name is on the “ tip of your tongue , ” metacognition is working to inform you that the information is somewhere in memory , even though you are unable to remember it . People with depression or anxiety often feel as though they have lost control over their thoughts and behaviours . Their thinking and attention become fixed in patterns of brooding and dwelling on themselves and on threatening information . They develop cop-ing behaviours that they believe are helpful , but that can actually worsen and prolong emotional distress . This pattern of thinking is called cognitive-attentional syndrome ( cas ) . 44 14/10/10 5:18 PM"}
{"text_id": 3, "title": "A Provider's Guide to Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", "text": "6 Module 1 : Introduction to Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( b CBT ) OBJECTIVES • To understand CBT and the process of brief CBT • To identify key treatment considerations and problems most suitable for brief CBT • To learn how to assess the patient ’ s suitability for brief CBT What is Brief CBT , and Why Does It Require Specific Treatment Considerations ? CBT combines cognitive and behavioral therapies and has strong empirical support for treating mood , sleep , chronic pain , and anxiety disorders ( Hoffman & Otto , 2017 ; Lepping et al. , 2017 ; Shatkin , 2018 ) . The basic premise of CBT is that emotions are difficult to change directly , so CBT targets emotions by changing thoughts and behaviors that are contributing to the distressing emotions . Figure 1. 1 . Cognitive Behavioral Model This training manual is focused on second-generation CBT ( Beckian Cognitive Therapy ) , which focuses on using cognitive restructuring and relaxation techniques to influence behavior change . From this perspective , we may understand situational feelings as influencing thought patterns , behavioral responses , and long-lasting emotional states . CBT builds a set of skills that enables individuals to 1 . Identify how situations influence thoughts and behaviors 2 . Become aware of the connection between thoughts , behaviors , and emotions 3 . Improve emotional states by changing unhelpful thinking styles and behaviors linked to negative emotional sates . The process of CBT skill acquisition is collaborative . Skill acquisition and homework assignments are what set CBT apart from “ talk therapies ” and nondirective therapies . Time in session should be used to help the patient obtain skills to address the presenting problem and not simply to discuss the issue with the patient or offer advice . Identifying and changing unhelpful thoughts and behaviors sets CBT apart from third-wave therapies such as acceptance and commitment therapy , mindfulness-based therapies , and dialectical behavior therapy . ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 1 SITUATION THOUGHTS FEELINGS BEHAVIORS 7 Brief CBT is the compression of CBT material and reduction of the average 12-20 sessions into four to eight sessions . In brief CBT the concentration is on specific treatments for a limited number of the patient ’ s problems . Specificity of the treatment is required because of the limited number of sessions . Additionally , the patient is asked to be diligent in using extra reading materials and homework to assist in his or her therapeutic growth . Brief CBT can range in duration from patient to patient and provider to provider . The exact length of treatment will be determined by a host of factors involving the provider , patient , and treatment setting . Although variability exists , the table below shows an example session-by-session outline . You are encouraged to think flexibly in determining length of treatment . As indicated in the table , you are not expected to rigidly adhere to a `` set schedule '' of progress or topics but rather should be flexible and adaptive in approaching brief CBT applications . Time-limited therapy may offer additional incentives for patients and providers to work efficiently and effectively . For example , it is often helpful to work within a `` session-limited framework '' in which the patient receives four-to-six sessions of `` active '' treatment , followed by one or more follow-up sessions that occur at increasing intervals after the active-treatment phase ( e. g. , two weeks posttreatment with an additional booster four weeks after that ) . ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 1 8 Table 1. 1 Potential Brief CBT Session Structure When ? Indications/Contraindications Certain problems are more appropriate for brief CBT than others . The following table summarizes problems that may and may not be conducive to brief CBT . Problems amenable to brief CBT include , but are not limited to , adjustment , anxiety , and depressive disorders . Therapy also may be useful for problems that target specific symptoms ( e. g. , depressive thinking ) or lifestyle changes ( e. g. , problem solving , relaxation ) , whether or not these issues are part of a formal psychiatric diagnosis . Brief CBT is particularly useful in a primary care setting for patients with anxiety and depression associated with a medical condition .

Issues that may be addressed in primary care with brief CBT include , but are not limited to , diet , exercise , sleep , pain , medication compliance , mental health issues associated with a medical condition , and coping with a chronic illness or new diagnosis ( Cully et al. , 2017 ) . Other problems may not be suitable for the use of brief CBT or may complicate a straightforward application of brief CBT . Axis II disorders , such as Borderline Personality Disorder or Antisocial Personality Disorder , are not typically appropriate for a shortened therapeutic experience , because of the pervasive social , psychological , and relational problems individuals with these disorders experience . Patients exhibiting comorbid conditions also may not be appropriate because the presence of a second issue may impede progress in therapy . For example , an individual with substance dependence secondary to major depression may not be appropriate because substance use requires a higher level of care and more comprehensive treatment than is available in a brief format . However , brief CBT could be used with Axis II and comorbid concerns in dealing with specific negative behaviors or in conjunction with more intensive treatment . Table 1. 2 Examples of Suitable and Unsuitable Problems for Brief CBT How ?

Below are important points to consider in selecting patients for brief CBT . This assessment should precede the treatment phase . It may be based on the intake assessment , input from the referral source , or a review of the medical chart . Highlight 1. 1 Things to Consider in Evaluating Patients for Brief CBT 1 . Strong Motivation to Change a . Increased distress is often associated with increased motivation to change . b . Positive treatment expectancies ( e. g. , knowledge of CBT and perceived benefits of treatment ) are associated with improved outcomes . Alternatively , the patient does not have negative self-thoughts that might impede progress or change ( e. g. , `` Seeking care means I am crazy ” ; `` Nothing I will do can change things '' ) . c. Patients who have clear goals for treatment are good candidates . 2 . Time Commitment a . Patient is willing to devote the time needed for weekly or biweekly sessions . b . Patient is willing to devote energy to out-of-session work ( e. g. , homework ) . 3 . Life Stressors and Social Support a . Too many life stressors may lead to unfocused work and/or frequent `` crisis-management '' interventions . b . Patients supported by family and friends are more likely to benefit . 4 . Cognitive Functioning and Educational Level a . Independent homework assignments and reading materials may require adjustment according to patients ’ cognitive status and educational level . b . Patients able to work independently are more likely to carry out between-session work . c. Patients who are psychologically minded are more likely to benefit from short-term therapy . 5 . Severity of Psychopathology a . Patients with comorbid psychopathology may be more difficult to treat in short-term therapy . In addition , some conditions such as substance abuse or serious mental illness require focused and more intensive interventions . b . Patients with an Axis II diagnosis are also less likely to benefit from short-term CBT . Long-standing interpersonal issues often require longer treatment durations . 12 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 1 SUPPLEMENTAL READINGS Beck , J. S . ( 2011 ) .

Information contained in this manual will provide you with basic knowledge of CBT concepts and attempt to provide you with practical tips on how to use these concepts . However , because the provision of CBT is highly variable , depending on the provider , patient , and treatment setting , applications of CBT will need to be customized and practiced in real- world settings . This manual is , therefore , only the first step toward CBT competency . Supervision and consultation are two methods to advance CBT practice skills through routine feedback and interaction with a knowledgeable CBT provider who can serve as a trainer/consultant . What is Supervision , and Why Is It Important to CBT ? Supervision is designed to a ) foster the supervisee 's development and b ) ensure patient welfare and safety by monitoring patient care . Supervision is NOT therapy ; although supervision may involve an exploration of a provider ’ s personal experiences , such a focus is restricted to issues that influence the provider ’ s professional work ( see following table . ) Table 2. 1 Goals and Focus of Supervision ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 2 For the Supervisee• Provides provider performance feedback • Provides guidance and acquisition of alternative viewpoints • Contributes to the process of forming a provider ’ s identity • Serves as a secure base to explore applications and therapeutic principles For the Patient• Ensures that patients receive acceptable care » Providers do no harm » Providers possess sufficient skills » Those who lack skills are provided with remediation 14 SUPERVISION VERSUS CONSULTATION There is a difference between supervision and consultation . Whereas supervision involves the direct oversight of clinical cases over a period of time ( often involving evaluation of the provider ) , consultation refers to a relationship designed to assist in professional development that does not involve formal oversight of clinical cases and may or may not continue over time . In essence , consultation involves a growth-oriented discussion of cases or issues without oversight or evaluation . When ? ( Indications/Contraindications ) Ideally , supervision or consultation occurs on a regular basis . Typically , for providers learning CBT , supervision/consultation should occur every week or every other week . Monthly consultation meetings may be appropriate for licensed practitioners in a more advanced stage of psychotherapy training . Supervision and/or consultation may also augment workshop-based training , with the workshop building initial skills and consultation/supervision helping the provider to deliver high-quality care during real-world applications . How ? ( Instructions/Handouts ) The following table outlines the most common formats for supervision . The usefulness of each procedure will be determined by the goals of supervision and the supervisee ’ s level of training and developmental needs . Exposure to multiple training modalities is seen as most effective . ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 2 15 Table 2. 2 Common Formats for Supervision ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 2 Format Description Advantages Disadvantages Verbal Report Providers verbally report the details of a given therapy session , or case , to the supervisor. • Less threatening to providers • Allows free-flowing discussion between provider and supervisor• Subject to provider recollection ( errors and omissions ) • Limited ability for supervisors to monitor and provide feedback on the “ process ” of therapy Process Notes Providers write down and recount issues identified in session along with their own personal reactions and feelings encountered in the session. • Less threatening to providers • Provide a more detailed recount of the session ( compared with verbal report alone ) • Begin to identify provider issues during session ( process ) • Subject to provider focus and recollection • Limited ability to monitor and provide feedback on the process of therapy Audio/Video Recording Actual sessions are audio or video recorded and reviewed in supervision. • Provides access to objective and process content of sessions • Serves as an excellent learning tool• Can be intimidating to providers ( and sometimes to patients ) • Logistical issues – specific informed consent for patients , availability of equipment Live Supervision The supervisor is in the room ( connected through audio/visual technology ) with the supervisee and patient or watching through a double-sided window . The supervisor does not engage in direct therapy , but instead the supervisee consults with the supervisor in the presence of the patient . • Provides the supervisor with real-time evidence of supervisee ’ s clinical skills development • Allows the supervisee to enhance therapeutic approaches and/or learn alternative approaches in real-time with a patient • Possibility of missing nonverbal cues during the consulting encounter if connected by telephone . • Possibility of novice providers being threatened or anxious • Possibility of patient discomfort with this approach . • Possibility of reduction in credibility of novice provider with patients if the intent for this modality is not adequately explained at the outset Group Supervision Multiple providers interact with supervisor in group format . • Provides provider-to-provider learning • Uses all the above techniques in addition to group format• Less individual emphasis , not as much time for each individual 16 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 2 SELECTING A SUPERVISOR / CONSULTANT The following are characteristics to seek out in selecting a CBT supervisor or consultant : 1 . CBT knowledge and practice experience • Ideally , CBT supervisors and consultants have received formal training in CBT and use CBT in their daily clinical practice . 2 . Availability • For those first learning how to apply CBT , it is highly recommended that you identify supervisors/consultants who are available for weekly or bi-weekly meetings that involve anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes per meeting . The actual length of meetings can be determined by the number of cases being reviewed . • Consider logistical issues in scheduling . Would the supervisor/consultant be available for in-person or telephone sessions ( in-person is more effective ) ? Consider proximity , travel , and availability of resources ( e. g. , audio/video recording ) . 3 . Experience with a patient population similar to those you will be serving , as well as considering experience with brief or longer-term therapy . SUPPLEMENTAL READINGS Bernard , J. M. & Goodyear , R.

CBT is structured and goal-directed . The context is supportive , and the techniques are paired with a collaborative therapeutic stance . Therapeutic skills refer to the relationship components of therapy ( e. g. , rapport , installation of hope , trust , collaboration ) and are comparable with treatment-specific skills that refer to the technical aspects of the psychotherapy orientation ( e. g. , the actual techniques such as guided imagery , thought challenging , etc. ) . Therapeutic skills are common within all psychotherapies and serve as the foundation for patient improvement . Refer to intervention techniques unique to the type of therapy being provided ( e. g. , CBT , psychodynamic , interpersonal ) . Studies show that therapeutic skills are responsible for a large percentage of the change associated with psychotherapy treatments . When ? ( Indications/Contraindications ) Therapeutic skills are critical during the early stages and important at all phases of treatment . Strong therapeutic skills aid in engaging and retaining patients in psychotherapy and also strengthen the technical components of treatment . Patients who perceive the therapeutic relationship to be collaborative , safe , and trusting are in a better position to obtain benefit from the treatment , will likely be less resistant and more open to exploration and change . As treatment progresses , the therapeutic relationship should become stronger , allowing the provider and patient to gradually move into more complex and meaningful therapeutic issues . How ? ( Instructions/Handouts ) Borrowing from person-centered therapy , this module focuses on four factors ( Figure 3. 1 ) important to the development of a strong therapeutic relationship . These factors are empathy , genuineness , and positive regard . These concepts are defined and discussed and represent general characteristics that all providers should attain in working with patients . Following a discussion of these principles , active listening is introduced as a technique to better attain a solid therapeutic relationship . EMPATHY ( VALIDATING THE PATIENT 'S EXPERIENCE ) Empathy is the ability to understand experiences from another person ’ s point of view . Empathy is an important part of building rapport and facilitates feelings of trust and mutual respect between the patient and provider . It is impossible for a provider to be knowledgeable about every patient 's unique background . Empathy , which at its core 18 consists of asking questions in a respectfully curious manner and expressing emotional understanding of the answers received , is a solid first step towards understanding patients ' unique life background . Additional reading about cultural differences may facilitate more informed questions and better prepare the provider for additional questions and/or rapport development . Showing empathy to patients helps to validate their experiences . Being critical , even subtly , of what patients are sharing in therapy often makes them feel judged and unwilling to disclose additional information . Use validating responses to show empathy towards a patient . Validating responses are simply statements of understanding of your patient ’ s viewpoint . Validating responses usually entails the provider ’ s describing what the provider heard the patient say , in a nonjudgmental manner . Figure 3. 1 Developing a Strong Therapeutic Relationship GENUINENESS Genuineness is the ability to be authentic and free of deceit or judgment . You can be professional and express who you are at the same time . Genuineness helps build rapport and solidify a therapeutic relationship by allowing the patient to view the provider as a human being . Patients often assess the genuineness of the provider for credible feedback about progress in their functioning . ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 3 STRONG THERAPEUTIC RELA TIONSHIPEMPATHY ( Validating the Patients ’ Experience ) GENUINENESS ( Being Authentic ) POSITIVE REGARD ( Respect ) ACTIVE LISTENING 19 Genuineness consists of a wide variety of concepts ranging from nonverbal behaviors to overt statements . Examples of factors related to genuineness include : Supporting nonverbal behavior : Providers should be aware of their own nonverbal behaviors like keeping eye contact , giving a patient your full attention like substitute such as for like keeping eye contact , giving a patient your full attention , and nodding in agreement or understanding . It ’ s important that these nonverbal behaviors match what is going on in the conversation , so as not to seem unnatural or inauthentic . Role behavior : CBT providers encourage patients to be active and empowered and subsequently attempt to facilitate this development through their behaviors in therapy . Providers that stress their authority in and between sessions with patients can cause a patient to feel inferior or intimidated . It is important to remember that the therapeutic relationship is one of partnership and the provider and patient work together to alleviate concerns , fears , and problems in the patient ’ s life . Congruence : Making sure that your words , nonverbal behavior , and feelings match each other is referred to as congruence . Not demonstrating congruence of your feelings and thoughts can become confusing or misleading to a patient . Spontaneity : This concept deals with the way the provider speaks and the timeliness of responses . Responses and feedback provided `` in the moment '' are more valuable than feedback provided at a later time . Patients are more likely to receive spontaneous messages as genuine . POSITIVE REGARD Positive regard simply means showing all patients the respect they deserve . It ’ s essential to show patients that they are valued and that what they have to say is important . Patients who feel that their thoughts and feelings are acknowledged and understood often share more and feel more connected to the provider and the therapeutic process . Communicating positive regard may be harder than it seems , especially if you hold some negative beliefs about the person you are trying to help . Sharing any negative feelings or beliefs about your patients with your supervisor or consultant can be an excellent method to ensure that you develop and demonstrate genuine positive regard toward your patients . Commitment to the patient means that you are dedicated to working with patients on whatever issues they are bringing to therapy . This includes being on time , avoiding canceling patients ’ appointments , and using all efforts to help patients work through these issues . Having a nonjudgmental attitude towards the thoughts , feelings , and actions of the patient is essential . It is possible to accept and understand a perspective without necessarily agreeing with it . ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 3 20 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 3 Displaying warmth towards patients is a vital part of building rapport . Warmth can be displayed through tone of voice , facial expressions and body postures , or the thoughtfulness of your responses . The following section addresses the concept of active listening . Active listening is a useful technique to communicate the nonspecific factors of empathy , genuineness , and positive regard . ACTIVE LISTENING Listening to your patients is the foundation of all therapeutic approaches . Listening is made up of three steps : receiving a message , processing it , and sending it back . Providers should attempt to remain open to all messages from their patients ( both verbal and nonverbal ) and attempt to process as many messages as possible . Clarification : Since we all speak from our own frame of reference , messages we send to others may not be received in the way we intend . Clarification is a useful and necessary tool for all providers . Clarification can be used to help simplify a message that is being sent by patients or to help confirm the accuracy of what providers think they have understood . In-Session Example 3. 1 Notice that the clarifying statement and question helped the provider and patient to more fully explore her feelings and thoughts . Given this new information , the provider is in a better position to explore the patient 's concerns and to set up targeted efforts and strategies for treatment . Paraphrasing and Reflection : These techniques involve restating the patient ’ s main thoughts in a different way or reflecting back the emotions the patient is currently experiencing to gain depth or clarification . Patient I just do not feel like trying any more . Provider : Tell me more about what you mean. Patient : I just feel like giving up Provider : Do you mean giving up on your goal to complete college ; or are you referring to something different , like giving up on life and possibly harming yourself ? Patient : I am not referring to suicide , if that is what you mean ; but I am feeling really depressed . Each day seems like such a struggle , and I often just feel like staying in bed . When I said “ give up , ” I guess I was referring to not wanting to face all the struggles I face in life … my school work , financial problems , relationship problems , etc . 21 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 3 In-Session Example 3. 2 In this example of paraphrasing , the provider gives back to the patient what he or she heard , which allows the patient to hear her own words and react with a more detailed response . The use of paraphrasing in this example facilitated a deeper understanding of the issue but also conveyed to the patient a feeling of being heard and understood . Listening for Themes and Summary Statements : Often , patients express thoughts , feelings and behaviors that become thematic across situations . Although novice providers may initially have difficulties identifying this thematic content , repetition over time ( e. g. , across sessions ) usually helps to create a clearer picture of the salient therapeutic issues that require attention or focus . With experience , providers become more effective and efficient at identifying thematic content . Once identified , thematic content can be a very powerful mechanism to influence treatment outcomes . Summarization is the technique that brings thematic content into the purview of the patient . Summarization is a condensed phrasing of the patient ’ s responses over a specific period of time ( e. g. , across the session , since the outset of treatment , since the onset of his/her current difficulties . ) You should rephrase the themes , and repeat them back to the patient for clarification . BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES TO BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP Setting limits in an empathetic manner is an essential tool for new providers . Many new providers desire to “ make it all better , ” in that they may coddle and console the patient and are distracted from working on deeper issues . A provider can create a holding environment through empathetic words and active listening . A holding environment is a setting in which the patient feels like he or she is being heard and that he or she is in a safe and secure place to voice thoughts and feelings without judgment . Moving from rapport and relationship building to assessment and goal setting can be challenging . When provider and patient are “ on the same page , ” this transition appears Patient : Since my fiancé ’ s death , I feel like every day is a struggle ; and I often question whether my life will ever get better . I just miss him so much that I think about him constantly . I don ’ t know what to do , but the pain is getting to be too much . Provider : You are really struggling to feel better , and much of your pain comes from the grief and loss you feel from losing your fiancé . You may even be questioning whether or not this pain will subside because it is getting unmanageable . Patient : Yes , that is correct . I do not want you to think that I think only about the pain of losing him . The pain I feel comes from my intense feelings of loss , but this pain is also because I miss all the things he meant to me and the joy he brought to my life . I am really struggling because I do not want to let go of him , but holding on hurts so much . 22 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 3 seamless . Often , however , patients and providers are not speaking the same language . For example , a provider may feel most comfortable when tackling a certain issue first ; whereas a patient may wish to focus on a different problem first . When the provider and patient are not in congruence regarding goals , the move between rapport building and goal setting is strained . To overcome this issue , providers are encouraged to use motivational interviewing strategies ( see Rollnick , Butler , and Mason – Chapters 3 , 4 , and 5 ) . Primary techniques involve listening to the patient , following the patient 's lead and/or motivation , and setting collaborative and mutually agreed-upon goals . A vital aspect to transitioning from rapport to goal setting involves assessing the importance , confidence , and readiness of the patient about specific treatment goals ( see Goal Setting , Module 8 ) .

Assessing patient concerns/difficulties b . Establishing a treatment plan ( goal setting ) c. Identifying treatment obstacles What Are Case Conceptualization and Treatment Planning , and Why Are They Important in Brief CBT ? Case conceptualization is a framework used to 1 ) understand patients and their current problems , 2 ) inform treatment and intervention techniques and 3 ) serve as a foundation to assess patient change/progress . Case conceptualization also aids in establishing rapport and a sense of hope for patients . Case conceptualization is vital to effective treatment and represents a defining characteristic of expert providers . Using these skills , providers are better able to define a treatment plan using intervention techniques that provide the best opportunities for change . This focused and informed approach provides the roadmap for both patients and providers and should include a foundation for assessing change/progress using measurement-based care principles . Case conceptualization ( Figure 4. 1 ) is particularly important for short-term therapy , as it serves to focus both the patient and clinician on the salient issues to avoid ancillary problems that often serve as distractions to core goals . Figure 4. 1 Case Conceptualization CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION 24 When ? ( Indications / Contraindications ) • To better should begin during the first session and become increasingly refined as treatment progresses . • An assessment of current difficulties and the creation of a problem list should occur during the first session . • A treatment plan ( including treatment goals ) should be addressed early in treatment ( sessions 1 , 2 ) . Early conceptualization and treatment planning may require modification as additional information becomes available . • Treatment plans and goals should be routinely revisited to ensure that the patient is improving and agrees with the flow of the therapeutic work . How ? ( Instructions/Handouts ) 1 . CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION STEP 1 : Assessing Patient Concerns/Difficulties The patient ’ s presenting concerns and current functioning can be assessed in a number of different ways . The following section outlines several possible avenues for identifying problems/concerns . A ) Using established self-report symptom inventories . A common practice in CBT involves the use of self-report symptom measures to assess baseline functioning as well as therapeutic progress . Frequently used measures for depression and anxiety include the Beck Depression Inventory – Second Edition , Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ( depression ) , Geriatric Depression Scale , Beck Anxiety Inventory , and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale . Self-report measures are often completed by patients while in the waiting room and evaluated by the clinician during the session . Often self-report measures can serve as a routine agenda item during CBT sessions and highlight important improvements and/or continuing symptoms . Information obtained from these self-report inventories can also provide insight into the way the patient thinks and behaves and factors that might be important areas of need and will inform treatment progress and treatment continuation/discontinuation . B ) Problem lists . These are a common and useful strategy for identifying the psychological , social , occupational , and financial difficulties faced by patients . Providers who use problem lists typically elicit a list of five to 10 difficulties from the patient during the first part of session 1 . Problems are best identified using open-ended questions ( e. g. , “ What brings you to this clinic ? ” “ What issues would you like to focus on in our work together ? ” ) . Problems are best described in terms of symptom frequency ( How often does the symptom occur ? ) , intensity ( How mild or severe is it ? ) and functional impact ( What influence does the symptom have on daily functioning or general distress ? ) . ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 4 25 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 4 Some patients may describe their difficulties or goals in vague or abstract ways , such as , “ I want to improve my life , ” or I want to be happy again. ” Problems and subsequent goals are best described in specific terms to maintain clinical focus . For example , specific problems are listed in the following table . Table 4. 1 Problem List Example C ) Assessing cognitions . Within the CBT model , it is often helpful to examine the patient ’ s thoughts , especially how the patient perceives them . A commonly used , structured way to examine these factors is to assess ( ask questions related to ) how the patients perceives themselves . For example , a patient might self-describe as incapable , not useful , or a burden . They may generally perceive others to be critical or hard to please . And their view of the future might be largely pessimistic and involve beliefs that the future will include only more losses and disappointments ( see also Thought Records in Modules 11 and 12 ) . D ) Assessing behaviors and precipitating situations . Precipitating situations are events , behaviors , thoughts , or emotions that activate , trigger , or compound patient difficulties . The Antecedents , Behavior , Consequences ( ABC ) Model is a model for examining behavior ( symptoms ) in a larger context . It postulates that behaviors are largely determined by antecedents ( events that precede behavior/thoughts/mood ) and consequences ( events that follow the behavior/thoughts/mood ) . The ABC model ( see worksheet at the end of this module ) is used in a functional assessment . It follows the premise that behavior ( B ) is shaped by antecedents ( A ) and consequences ( C ) . The antecedent occurs before a behavior and may be a trigger for a particular reaction in the patient . Behavior is any activity ( even a thought or feeling ) that the patient exhibits in response to an antecedent . Consequences are events that occur after the behavior and direct the patient to either continue or discontinue the behavior . Problem Frequency Severity Impact Social Isolation Stay at home six of seven days Limited social contacts : moderate-to-severe isolation Highly distressing ; socially debilitating ; estranged family/friends Pain Experience pain each hour Pain intensity is high , 7 out of 10 , when present Pain leading to decreased activity level , inability to work Feelings of Worthlessness Occur three of seven days Very intense when present ; sometimes involve suicidal thoughts Highly distressing ; influence work , social , and intimate relationships Fatigue Occurs almost constantly Not intense but troublesome Decreased activity level , frequent naps , inability to complete daily tasks 26 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 4 Two kinds of consequences are examined in a functional assessment : short-term and long-term consequences . A ) Antecedents : Antecedents , or events that occur before a behavior , typically elicit emotional and physiological responses . Antecedents may be affective ( an emotion ) , somatic ( a physiological response ) , behavioral ( an act ) , or cognitive ( a thought ) . They are also subject to contextual ( situational ) and relational ( interpersonal ) factors . For example , patients who report depressed mood ( emotion ) may feel bad when they are alone at home late at night ( contextual antecedent ) or better when they are around family ( relational antecedent ) . Alternatively , they may feel depressed by thinking , “ I will always be alone ” ( cognitive antecedent ) . It ’ s important to remember that antecedents can both increase and decrease a particular behavior . To help your patiens identify antecedents , teach them to pinpoint conditions that affect their behavior . In-Session Example 4. 1 “ What were you feeling right before you did that ? ” ( Affective ) “ What happens to you physically before this happens ? Do you feel sick ? ” ( Somatic ) “ How do you normally act right before this happens ? ” ( Behavioral ) “ What thoughts go through your mind before this happens ? ” ( Cognitive ) “ Where and when does this usually happen ? ” ( Contextual ) “ Do you do this with everyone , or just when you are around certain people ? ” ( Relational ) B ) Behaviors : A behavior is anything the patient does , feels , or thinks immediately following the antecedent . Each behavior that your patient displays could potentially include an affective component ( feelings or moods ) , a somatic component ( bodily sensations such as rapid heartbeat or stomachache ) , a behavioral component ( what a patient does or doesn ’ t do ) , and a cognitive component ( thoughts or beliefs ) . C ) Consequences : Consequences are categorized as being either positive or negative . Positive consequences increase the chances that a behavior will be repeated through the experience of something pleasant or the removal of something negative ( e. g. , do not have to do a chore ) . Negative consequences decrease the occurrence of a behavior , either by the presence of something noxious ( e. g. , being yelled at ) or the absence of something desired ( e. g. , a child being grounded from watching TV ) . Patients tend to repeat behaviors that result in something positive or the removal of something negative . Identifying Consequences . Similarly to identifying antecedents , when you and a patient are attempting to identify the consequences of a certain behavior , it is important to explore all components of each consequence . 27 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 4 In-Session Example 4. 2 “ How do you feel immediately after this occurs ? ” ( Affective ) “ Do you have any bodily sensations after this happens , like trembling ? ” ( Somatic ) “ How do you react after this behavior occurs ? ( Behavioral ) “ What do you think about after this happens ? ” ( Cognitive ) “ Are you in a different place when this behavior ends ? ” ( Contextual ) “ Are there any people who make this behavior worse ? Make it better ? ” ( Relational ) When completing a functional assessment , examine both short- and long-term consequences . Short-term consequences tend to be behavioral reinforcers , while long-term consequences tend to be negative outcomes . In the case of addiction , the short-term consequence of using a substance is intoxication , or escape from a negative mood ; the long-term consequence may be legal trouble , family problems , or a hangover . Understanding the positive and negative consequences of a behavior for a patient helps design the timing and nature of intervention . For example , in the case above , an intervention would need to follow a noxious antecedent to offset the negative mood it causes . Treating the negative mood would then decrease the need for escape through substance use . A variety of questions may be used to elucidate a short-term consequence : In-Session Example 4. 3 “ Does this behavior get you attention in some way ? ” “ What good things happen as a result of this behavior ? ” “ Does this help you in some way ? ” “ Do you feel a certain ‘ rush ’ from doing this ? ” “ Does this behavior help you avoid something you don ’ t want to do ? ” 2 . CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION STEP 2 : Clinical Hypotheses and Treatment Plan Establishing focused clinical hypotheses based upon the information obtained in Case Conceptualization Step # 1 serves to direct intervention options and possible treatment techniques . These hypotheses may require adaptation as new information becomes available during treatment . Clinical hypotheses can either be used exclusively by the provider or can be shared with patients . Generally , sharing this information improves trust and communication between patient and provider . A focused clinical hypothesis for a person with depression might be as follows : '' Since your retirement , you have experienced many life transitions and numerous losses ( e. g. , financial , social , functional ) . Your thoughts , which used to be largely positive and ambitious , are now negative and pessimistic ; and you appear to be fearful of the future . In 28 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 4 reaction to your mood and negative thoughts , you have reduced the number of your activities ; and you have begun to withdraw from your family . '' The end result of case conceptualization is formation of a treatment plan , an agreed-upon strategy between patient and provider that gives direction to the therapeutic process . A treatment plan should include a presentation of the causes of the patient 's current difficulties ( e. g. , cognitive and behavioral factors creating symptoms or difficulties ) and a specific plan . When presenting the plan , actively involve the patient and incorporate his or her feedback . In-Session Example 4. 4 Example : “ In the brief amount of time we have spent together , it appears that we have identified some thoughts and behaviors that are likely contributing to your current difficulties . In particular , your view of yourself and your future are quite negative ; and you have stopped doing many things that used to bring you pleasure . My recommendation would be to further explore your thoughts and see if we can find a more balanced view of your current difficulties . I would also like to talk with you more about re-engaging in activities you used to find pleasurable . What do you think about these targets for therapy ? '' 3 . CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION STEP 3 : Identifying Possible Treatment Obstacles It is not uncommon for patients to simply agree with recommendations from their provider . However , it is important to identify potential obstacles to treatment early on to avoid setbacks or treatment failures . Asking for frequent feedback from the patient helps to reduce over-compliance and serves to include the patient in a collaborative and active treatment approach . As part of this collaborative venture , it is important to ask patients whether they see any potential obstacles to treatment . Barriers might include logistic difficulties ( financial , travel ) , personal beliefs ( concerns about stigma , effectiveness of treatment ) or interpersonal issues ( family not supportive of therapy ) . 29 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 4 Highlight 4. 1 Tips for Using Case Conceptualization in Brief Therapy • Case conceptualization in brief CBT is much the same as with longer forms of treatment , with the following exceptions : » Brief therapy leaves little room for delays in case formulation . » The time constraints of brief therapy must be considered in all treatment/goal- setting endeavors . Treatment goals should be reasonable , measurable and as simple as possible . » Because of limited time , the focus of treatment in brief CBT also generally limits the depth of cognitive interventions . For example , it is quite frequent to address automatic thoughts and intermediate beliefs as foci of treatment , while addressing core beliefs is often difficult . If core beliefs are addressed , this usually occurs indirectly through more surface-level intervention techniques or at a time when the patient is particularly ready for such work . Homework Assignment Examples 1 . Think about our agreed-upon treatment plan , and consider any adjustments it might need . 2 . Make a list of any obstacles to therapy that may arise .

Culture defines individuals ’ specific “ ways of being ” that are shaped by the intersection of their identity and their lived experiences . Culture influences our behaviors and impacts our lifestyle choices , which is why it is an important factor in psychotherapy and therapeutic relationships . Not only should providers become aware of patients ’ unique cultures , but they should also consider their own culture to form genuine and effective therapeutic relationships . Cultural recognition and appreciation begin with an understanding of an individual ’ s race , age , and gender ; however , culture goes much deeper . Although two individuals may have similar physical identifiers of culture , past experiences and unseen forms of culture can create differences . For example , two Mexican American men may look the same and even be in the same age group . However , they may have grown up with different religions , in different socioeconomic groups , one with a single father and the other with two parents and his grandmother living in the home . Table 5. 1 is an inexhaustive list of cultural identifiers that influence an individual ’ s culture . 33 Table 5. 1 . Types of Cultural Identifiers ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 5 Cultural Identifier Definition Select Examples Race Human constructed classifications of major divisions of people based on biology and physical characteristics , often skin color , facial features , and hair type White , Black , Asian , Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander , American Indian/Alaska Native Ethnicity Classification of major divisions of people based on cultural traditions and nationality , often a combination of ancestry and customs African American , Italian American , Latinx/Hispanic , Native American , Mexican American Nationality The status of belonging to a nation , typically defined by origin of birth or citizenship American , Mexican , Chinese , Ethiopian , German , Indian Age/ Generation Classification of a group of people in the same birth cohort displaying similar values , due to shared global experiences Generation Z , Millennials , Generation X , Baby Boomers Sex Assignment of gender based on external genitalia Male , Female , Intersex Gender Human constructed classifications of people based on social constructs related to biological sex , masculinity , and femininity ; can differ from gender assigned at birth Man , Woman , Transgender , Non-binary or Gender Non-Conforming , Genderqueer/Gender fluid Sexual Orientation Describes romantic or sexual attraction towards others Heterosexual/Straight , Homosexual : Gay & Lesbian , Bisexual , Queer , Asexual , Pansexual Socio- economic Status Classification of social standing measured by level of education , income , and occupation that results in access to resources Upper Class , Upper-Middle Class , Middle Class , Working Class , Lower Class Religion Belief in a personal god or gods , associated with a system of faith and worship Christianity , Islam , Judaism , Hinduism , Buddhism , Nonreligiousness Disability A physical or mental condition that limits a person ’ s movements , senses , or activities , both visible and invisible Blindness , Deafness , Autism Spectrum Disorders , Dementia , Traumatic Brain Injury , Physical Impairments , Chronic Pain , Mental Illness Language Distinct methods of communication used by groups or communities of people English , Hindi , Arabic , Mandarin , Spanish , Zulu , American Sign Language , Braille Residence Current and historical location or status of an individual ’ s main place of dwelling or home. Urban , Rural , Homeless , Suburban , Affordable Housing , Temporary Housing 34 DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURAL IDENTITY Many models explain how culture develops over time . These models explain how individuals interpret their identity through interactions with others , and their basis is often minority or majority status . For example , an integrated model of cultural/racial development from Hoffman and Hoffman ( 2006 ) is included , which depicts various stages of development and how these stages interact with others ’ development ( found in Table 5. 2 ) . You and your patient may be at different stages of the model , which may impact the conceptualization of your respective cultures , how culture influences the therapeutic interaction , and how culture influences the interpretation of stressors and symptoms . The Hoffman and Hoffman model emphasizes the importance of recognizing minority and majority status when considering culture . Use this model to guide conceptualization of culture and , more importantly , to consider cultural stages as part of the overall therapeutic process . The Hoffman and Hoffman model provides one example , but you may wish to use other cultural models in your practice , such as : • Black American Racial Identity by William Cross ( 1991 ) • White Racial Identity Model by Janet Helms ( 1990 ) • Stages of Acculturation by John W. Berry ( 2005 ) • Filipino American Racial Identity Model by Kevin Nadal ( 2011 ) ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 5 35 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 5 Stage I. Conformity ( All ) Everyone “ conforms ” to the majority society to emulate the way the majority acts , speaks , dresses , and believes , because the majority is perceived as positive . Stage II . Minority Group Majority Group Dissonance The minority group realizes that its race or gender may preclude it from the benefits of the majority group . It begins to see that racism and sexism may be impacting it . Acceptance The majority group can diminish comments or actions that indicate racism or sexism is alive . It feels the minority should be more like it or dismiss the effects of minority status . Stage III . Immersion Due to the effects of racism and sexism , members of minority groups begin to feel negative emotions towards the majority group. Resistance Members of majority group may feel that racism and sexism do not exist and can express beliefs about “ reverse racism ” or “ reverse sexism. ” Stage IV . Emersion Anger towards the majority group causes minorities to associate only with the group they belong to , avoiding contact with the majority. Retreat When the majority group ’ s assumptions about minorities are proven false , it may feel guilt and shame about how difficult life is for minorities . It may also feel frustration towards other members of its own group who do not agree . Stage V. Internalization Minority groups realize that there are negative qualities about their own people and that not all members of the majority group are the enemy . They begin to see that racism and sexism can be fought against . Emergence Members of the majority start to understand their privilege and how it continues to benefit them . Stage VI . Integrative Awareness ( All ) Both majority and minority group members positively identify their own cultural/racial identity and acknowledge other aspects of both their own and others ’ identities . Table 5. 2 Integrated Model of Cultural/Racial Development ( Hoffman & Hoffman , 2006 ) 36 CULTURE AND PSYCHOTHERAPY The goal of culturally competent psychotherapy is to ensure that patients ’ experiences and culture are considered when providing care . Optimal care is achieved when both the provider and patient are collaborative in the treatment . Appropriate consideration of patients ’ backgrounds and experiences results in patients ’ feeling heard and understood , creating a safe space for patients to express themselves . Acknowledging your patient ’ s culture provides an opportunity to fully understand the patient and conveys a level of openness that encourages discussion and exploration of other factors important in the psychotherapy process . Traditional CBT and Western models of psychotherapy typically have not considered or accounted for ethnic and cultural values and beliefs of patients . Historically , minority patients have high dropout rates , due to various challenges to care , such as : 1 . Psychotherapy can feel “ foreign ” to non-Western or underrepresented groups because emotional expression and discussing personal experiences may conflict with certain values . For example , some groups view expressing emotions as weak or unstable . Also , some may view discussing themselves as rude or insensitive to others . 2 . Inflexible use of manualized treatments can feel impersonal and too formal for patients , limiting the possibility for patients to feel like a collaborative partner in their care . Manualized treatments are developed to be efficacious and are typically not created to be culturally sensitive . 3 . When mismatch between the provider and patient ’ s gender , race , age , etc . are not appropriately acknowledged , it can limit patients ’ comfort in expressing themselves . When ? ( Indications/Contraindications ) You should be aware of your patients ’ and your own cultural identity . Given the importance of the therapeutic relationship in psychotherapy , it is critical to not only communicate and model nonspecific factors ( e. g. , warmth , genuineness ) but also consider culture and factors of diversity as a process that occurs initially and throughout the therapy process . IMPACT OF CULTURE ON MENTAL HEALTH Look to minimize any negative outcomes associated with the intersection of culture and mental health . The Transactional Model of Stress and Coping ( Figure 5. 1 . ) describes how patients react or appraise stressful situations or triggering events and , subsequently , how they seek to cope with those stressors , based on their initial appraisal . Patients appraise situations through their own cultural lens , based on their own past experiences of coping and the experiences of others close to them . In addition , stressors and triggering events can be cultural in nature . For example , experiencing discrimination at work or receiving a life-altering medical diagnosis or physical/mental disability impacts both our culture and our mental health . If you are aware and accepting of cultural differences when assessing and treating mental health issues , you will be better informed and in tune with your patients ’ needs. ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 5 37 Figure 5. 1 : The Transactional Model of Stress and Coping ( Folkman , Lazarus , Gruen , & De Longis , 1986 ) EVALUATION OF PATIENTS ’ CULTURE Although providers are experts in mental health and mental health treatment , patients are experts of their own identity and life experiences . To provide treatment , providers should understand and be willing to explore each patient ’ s lived experiences . Do not assume that culture will always play a role in patients ’ psychopathology . Provide your patients with the opportunity to hypothesize how aspects of their culture may play a role . Examples of how to begin these conversations are provided below . Important to note : the patients may be clear as to how culture influences their symptoms , ongoing stressors , or presenting concerns . Therefore , understanding patients ’ experiences may be more helpful for the provider than the patient . EVALUATION OF PROVIDER ’ S CULTURE In addition to cultural considerations of the patient , consider your own cultural experiences . All individuals have unique experiences and backgrounds that may differ from another ’ s . Evaluating your own cultural experiences and past behaviors will inform ways in which you may interact with patients of different backgrounds . Personal experiences contribute to explicit and implicit biases , which impact how individuals interact with others.

Under ideal circumstances , cultural differences create opportunities for individuals to learn about others ’ cultures , highlight commonalities among shared cultural experiences , and develop awareness of differing experiences . However , cultural differences can also lead to negative experiences and outcomes , such as discrimination , stereotypes , and injustice . Providers and patients bring their own lived experiences to the therapeutic relationship , but it is imperative to model behaviors that attend to cultural differences . This may be the first time your patient is introduced to the concept of cultural difference and , thus , negative outcomes can be directed towards you . Just as patients can be negatively impacted by not acknowledging culture , you as a provider can be discriminated or stereotyped . Both you and your patient may experience discrimination . Discrimination is the mistreatment of individuals based on societal or personal views of an aspect of their culture being inferior . Discrimination can be direct , such as overt racism and sexism , or indirect , such as microaggressions . Microaggressions are intentional or unintentional slights or behaviors directed towards others that indicate social inferiority , hostility , or derogation . For example , a teacher telling parents of an African American student that she is so articulate and well mannered may be an unintentional microaggression . Even though the teacher is trying to compliment the student , the teacher may be making a microaggression because of the underlying societal stereotype that African American students would present otherwise . Both providers and patients should attend to the possibility of microaggressions and discuss any occurrences as much as possible in the moment . Awareness of explicit and implicit biases presented in Table 5. 3 can help prevent microaggressions and discrimination from occurring . Table 5. 3 Example of Explicit and Implicit Bias ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 5 39 Table 5. 3 Biases How ? ( Instructions/Handouts ) You can use many techniques and methods to explicitly integrate culture into psychotherapy in both extended and brief treatment contexts . The following sections provide guidance and techniques to assist you when attending to culture and integrating culture into your practice . ORIENT THE PATIENT TO BRIEF , TECHNICAL TREATMENT . Discuss the patient ’ s perspective of therapy and any perceived barriers : • What are your thoughts about coming to psychotherapy ? What do you want to know about therapy ? What do you think about providers ? Have you been in therapy before ? • How does your family view psychotherapy ? Your friends ? Your partner ? Do they know ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 5 Explicit Bias Definition : Attitudes and beliefs we have about a person or group on a conscious level . Individuals are aware of this bias and express it directly. Implicit Bias Definition : Attitudes and beliefs we have about a person or group on an unconscious level . Individuals are unaware of this bias and express it subconsciously . General Examples : • A boss choosing not to interview an applicant after seeing the applicant ’ s dreadlocks . The boss feels that dreadlocks indicate he will not be a good employee or fit in with the company ’ s culture . • A male patient choosing not to work with any female providers because he assumes they are all judgmental , incompetent , and unhelpful . • Assuming a woman working in a hospital is a nurse instead of a doctor . • A White individual asking a Latinx individual where he was born , because she assumes most Latinx individuals are not U. S. citizens . Examples in Psychotherapy : • A female provider choosing to refer a transgender patient to her LGBT colleague , because she assumes she would not be able to understand the patient ’ s needs . She assumes the patient ’ s presenting concerns will be tied to being transgender . • A male provider skipping over the military sexual trauma questions during an assessment with a male veteran . He assumes only female veterans experience military sexual trauma . • A White provider being friendlier with White patients than with patients of color . • Appearing concerned or sad when a middle-aged female patient says she is single and does not have any children , assuming that being single would contribute to a negative emotional state . 40 that you are coming to therapy ? If so , what do/would they say ? How do they view people who attend therapy ? • What are ways therapy may be difficult for you ? What were some barriers you faced when making the decision to seek help ? How can we work together to prevent any future barriers ? • Our time together will be brief ; how have you dealt with brief relationships with other people that you ’ ve been close with in the past ? Exploring patients ’ culture can be difficult to achieve in time-limited therapy . It is common for a brief CBT provider to feel tension between sticking to the brief CBT therapy protocol and providing patients with enough time to expand on their experiences and concerns . However , most protocols emphasize the importance of building rapport ; and addressing culture can help you build this therapeutic alliance . The exact “ balance ” between listening/assessing and forming a strong therapeutic relationship with the time necessary to deliver technical/skill-focused interventions will depend on many factors , including the needs of the patient , the duration of treatment , and the provider ’ s skillfulness in rapidly and effectively forming a strong relationship while maintaining a focus on active , skill-oriented techniques . ASSESSMENT OF CULTURE WILL HELP GUIDE TREATMENT MODIFICATIONS . Begin assessing culture by asking broad , open-ended questions . Importantly , these questions can also be used to gather information about your own culture and experiences : • What aspects of your culture are important to you ? • What are some cultural experiences that have shaped your life ? • How has your background , the way you identify yourself , or cultural experiences impacted your symptoms or presenting concerns ? • How have your concerns/presenting issues affected aspects of your culture that are important to you ? To your family ? ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 5 41 Cultural Faux Pas Assuming pronouns/identifiers » Always ask about how individuals identify or how they ’ d prefer to be addressed . An individual ’ s race and gender may not match stereotypical classifications . Example : he/she/they ; Black/African American/Afro Caribbean ; Mexican American/Latino/Hispanic Using illegal immigrant or illegal alien » Use undocumented citizen or undocumented immigrant . Confusing gender and sexual orientation » Gender and sexual orientation are not correlated . Transgender individuals can identify as any sexual orientation , regardless of their gender or natal sex . Acknowledging the “ plight ” of living with disability » Referring to the strength or courage of someone living with a disability can come off as offensive and can minimize their identity . Associating race or gender with culture » Two individuals of the same race or gender will not always associate with the same culture . Varying backgrounds can cause unique cultural experiences . ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 5 Highlight 5. 1 YOUR APPROACH DURING TREATMENT SHOULD SHIFT , BASED ON YOUR PATIENT ’ S PRESENTATION . Providers use language during treatment based on their training , their theoretical orientation , and their own cultural experiences . However , often technical language , jargon , and various descriptors can make patients feel uncomfortable . Use your patients ’ language and cues to shift your approach and be more aligned with them . Some examples include referring to the treatment process as talk therapy or counseling instead of psychotherapy , describing the patient ’ s issues or concerns ( e. g. , “ I am no longer able to do what I used to do ” ) compared to symptoms used for diagnoses , using the term client rather than patient ( taking into consideration the clinical context of your work ) , or referencing stressors instead of situations or triggers . 42 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 5 CONSIDER V-CODES WHEN MAKING DIAGNOSES . The Diagnostic & I Statistical Manual , Fifth Edition includes diagnoses appropriate for patients when traditional diagnoses of psychopathology do not fit . Awareness of cultural influences may lead to consideration of these diagnoses , and they often decrease stigma related to receiving a more clinical diagnosis . These diagnoses are called “ other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention ” and are referred to as “ V Codes ” in the ICD-9-CM and “ Z Codes ” in the ICD-10-CM . Some of the diagnoses include : Tips 1 . Engage in life-long learning and professional growth . This brief chapter scratches only the surface of cultural awareness in psychotherapy . Ongoing training throughout your career will ensure that you are continuing to grow and develop your awareness of culture . 2 . “ Cultural competency ” is an evolving process . Due to the variable nature of human behavior and the complexity of culture , individuals will never reach full cultural competency and awareness . Your goal should be to practice being culturally competent , not assume that you have cultural competency . 3 . Be curious . While exploring your own and your patients ’ culture , be appropriately curious about culture . When struggling with what is appropriate or inappropriate , consider your patient ’ s perspective . What questions would you be OK with answering or being asked ? Relational Problems • Parent-Child Relational Problem • Upbringing Away from Parents • Relationship Distress with Spouse/ Intimate Partner • Uncomplicated Bereavement Social Problems • Target of ( Perceived ) Adverse Discrimination or Persecution • Acculturation Difficulty • Social Exclusion or Rejection • Problem Related to Living Alone Medical or Health Care Access Problems • Unavailability or Inaccessibility of Health Care Facilities • Unavailability or Inaccessibility of Helping Agencies Environmental or Psychosocial Problems • Religious or Spiritual Problem • Victim of Terrorism or Torture • Exposure to Disaster or War Educational/Occupational Problems• Academic or Educational Problem • Problem Related to Current Military Deployment Status • Problem Related to Employment Housing and Economic Problems • Homelessness or Inadequate Housing • Extreme Poverty or Low Income • Problem Related to Living in a Residential Institution • Lack of Adequate Food or Safe Drinking Water 43 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 5 SUPPLEMENTAL READINGS & REFERENCES American Psychiatric Association .

Conducting therapy with technology-based modalities has rapidly increased for mental health care . Specifically , using technology-based approaches as a means for providing psychological services has served to reduce mental health disparities and overcome distance-based barriers . Telemental health is the practice of using technology to provide mental health services and may include telephone , two-way video conferencing , mobile phone applications , web-based text messaging , email-based interventions , web-based chat messaging , or asynchronous telepsychiatry ( formerly store-and-forward services ) . These remote telecommunication modalities present opportunities to enhance mental health care through services offered clinic to clinic ( e. g. , provider located in one clinic while the patient is physically present at a different clinic location ) as well as from a provider directly into patients ’ homes or other secure locations . Telemental health services may be used effectively across an array of settings including , but not limited to , hospitals , short- and long-term care facilities , school systems , institutional correctional facilities , rural health centers , and community mental health clinics . Telemental health modalities are associated with clinical effectiveness , treatment adherence , patient and provider satisfaction , psychotherapeutic alliance outcomes , and cost effectiveness commensurate with services provided face-to-face . Telemental health services are useful in providing evidence-based psychotherapies to individuals , groups , and families . When ? ( Indications/Contraindications ) Technological advances and the subsequent integration into healthcare services have made remote delivery of mental health care accessible to underserved and disadvantaged populations . Telemental health services help minimize barriers that prevent patients ’ access to care when they need it ( see Figure 6. 1 ) . When traditional face-to-face therapies are unavailable or inaccessible , alternative treatment modalities may be appropriate for individuals that frequently travel for work , those who serve during military deployments , and people who work irregular schedules . 45 Figure 6. 1 Barriers to Mental Care Access CONSIDERATIONS Potential risks of using technological modalities when providing remote mental health treatment must be considered . Risks involve the need for crises management procedures as well as clinical issues , including the potential for negative impact on patient functioning . For example , patients with anxiety may have fears associated with avoidance that are potentially maintained by using telehealth services and thereby reducing exposure to feared stimuli ( e. g. , going out of the house ) . Additional precautions may be warranted to effectively observe and assess mobility ( e. g. , ask the patient to walk across the room in front of the camera ) and hygiene ( e. g. , inquire about the last time a patient showered or brushed their teeth ) . Patients may be offered various telemental health modalities , but it is the provider ’ s responsibility to ensure alignment with the patient ’ s presenting concerns as well as to be knowledgeable about data to support the intervention using the selected delivery method . Some smartphone applications , for example , provide treatment programs that are not empirically supported . Despite concerns about the appropriateness of technology-based modalities , telemental health services have been used successfully across an array of populations . ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 6 Barriers to Mental Health Care Access Transportation Difficulties Children Work Schedule School Schedule Mental Health Stigma Travel Time Distance 46• Age Group : Research has been conducted on telemental health with all age groups . Providers should determine whether patients can effectively use a desired telemental health modality through direct conversations with patients about acceptability and feasibility . Occasionally , patients from various age groups ( e. g. , older adults ) may require some education on how to use different modalities . Typically , younger patients are more likely to desire technology-based treatment . However , patients of all age groups can be instructed on how to use technology for treatment . • High Risk Populations : Clinical concerns arise when providing telemental health to patients who endorse current suicidal ideation or substance use . For patients with past suicidal ideation , consider the level of suicide risk , the length of time since the last reported episode of suicidal ideation , and the number of past episodes when deciding the appropriateness of telemental health . High risk patients in crisis often require focused and highly intensive treatment approaches that may make weekly therapy inappropriate . However , telehealth modalities may be an important element of a broader treatment approach that includes a mixture of face-to-face and virtual appointments . Ultimately , the decision to use telemental health with high-risk patients should be based upon clinical expertise ; and a clear emergency plan should always be identified ( i. e. , emergency contact , involving family and friends ) . • Patients with Severe Mental Illness : Telemental health can be conducted with patients who have been diagnosed with severe mental illnesses . However , patients who are not adherent to psychotropic medication or other treatment recommendations may not be appropriate for telemental health treatment . Distance may pose an ethical risk in ensuring the safety of your patient . As with high-risk suicide patients , the use of telemental health procedures for those with serious mental illness may be most effective as part of a interdisciplinary treatment plan . • Rural or Out-of-State Population : Telemental health is an optimal option for rural populations that do not have access to treatment . However , different states have regulations on providing treatment across state lines , which should be considered . • Exposure-Based Treatment : Telemental health services can increase effectiveness of treatment of anxiety- and trauma-related disorders . Patients can use technology in their environment , allowing you to guide them through relevant exposure exercises . • Treatment-Avoidant Populations : Telemental health options engage patients that may not otherwise use therapy . However , these care options can reinforce avoidance and limit patient progress in treatment . Use your clinical judgment to determine if a patient high in avoidance or low in motivation is appropriate for telemental health throughout the course of treatment . ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 6 47 PRIVACY Consider the environment of your patient to ensure appropriate levels of privacy during treatment . Telemental health services are an option for patients that have access to reliable , private technology software , especially if transportation is an issue . Stay-at-home parents or caretakers may have issues in connecting that are contingent upon their caregiver duties or responsibilities . Additionally , ensure that your facility or office has designated areas to conduct telephone or video sessions . It is important to ensure secure network connections and video conferencing software to meet privacy standards and HIPAA requirements . How ? ( Instructions/Handouts ) Providing telemental health services using technology can be a complicated process , and you should consider it on a case-by-case basis . As with any new procedure , you are encouraged to explore and be knowledgeable in the modalities and delivery . You must be vigilant and prepared ( proactive ) when using telehealth procedures . Various factors can be considered when using telemental health : ASSESSING PATIENT SAFETY Although no condition-specific populations are currently considered inappropriate for telemental health services , individual patient safety should always be considered before providing services through any telemental health modality . Current best practices include : 1 . Assessing patient ’ s current and past suicidal ideation 2 . Obtaining emergency contact information for the patient as well as others that may be at the same location of the patient during each session 3 . Obtaining the patient ’ s physical location and address for the duration of the session 4 . Obtaining contact information for the patient ’ s local emergency services and law enforcement agencies ( see American Psychiatric Association , American Telemedicine Association , and American Psychological Association in Resources ) 5 . Routine safety planning , which includes continuous monitoring of environmental changes such as patient ’ s appearance and sobriety level , as well as access to lethal means 6 . Establishment of crisis protocols , with consideration as to how these protocols may require deviations considering domestic violence situations and/or with patients located at settings other than those originally anticipated ( e. g. , patients may change locations to the home of a relative , friend , or other setting ) DETERMINING APPROPRIATENESS OF THE PATIENT ’ S CASE Prospective telehealth providers are strongly encouraged to engage in self-assessment related to the provision of psychotherapeutic services across an array of telehealth modalities . It is important to review issues spanning state and regulatory licensure , technology , ethics , professional relationships , and specific training requirements ( STEPS ) before providing telehealth services ( See Table 6. 1 ) . ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 6 48 Table 6. 1 Self-Study Considerations ( STEPS ) Prior to Engaging in Telehealth with Patients ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS | MODULE 6 State Licensure and Regulatory Issues State licensing restrictions where services will be provided State licensing requirements to provide telehealth services Specific state regulations for providing telehealth services Technology Issues Basic properties and operations of various telecommunication systems ( e. g. , internet & DSL ) Strengths and limitations of various equipment ( e. g. , plug-and-play devices , set-top devices , and roll-about videoconferencing systems ) Minimally acceptable video ( 15-18 frames per second ) and audio quality standards Ways to respond to equipment and telecommunication failures Patient understanding of the uses , installation requirements , benefits , and drawbacks of telecommunication technologies involved Ethical Issues Ways to communicate professional credentials and training to prospective telehealth patients Methods of obtaining informed consent in telehealth Confidentiality issues that must be addressed when providing telehealth Strategies to ensure confidentiality and privacy when providing telehealth Professional Relationship Issues Practice parameters for telehealth ( e. g. , length of sessions , protocols for managing poor technical reception , waiting time before considering a patient a “ no-show , ” record keeping , etc . ) Discussion of reimbursement issues with telehealth patients and/or third-party insurers Record-keeping requirements for providing telehealth services Reporting obligations ( e. g. , duty to warn ) in providing telehealth services How to manage situations that involve potential for self-harm and/or injury to others The types of information that should be included in a telehealth practice disclaimer Emergency coverage that will be provided for distant telehealth patients Information about the social or community network in which telehealth patient ( s ) reside Specific Training Patient ’ s knowledge and skill in using telecommunications equipment Professional telehealth training workshops , symposia , or caucuses The latest legislative , research , and clinical developments as informed by literature Telehealth research and practice literature related to the patients served Conceptual , methodological , and ethical issues in conducting telehealth assessments 49 DETERMINING PATIENT COMFORT The decision to integrate innovative telehealth modalities into your practice must be carefully considered and discussed with patients . You must consider patient comfort and familiarity with technology as a patient ’ s willingness to engage . Your patient ’ s opinion of telehealth modalities impacts outcomes of implementation and efficacy of service delivery . Additionally , it is important to consider only technologies that are accessible , practical , and feasible for the patient because a patient ’ s familiarity with technology may impact their view of a clinical professional ( e. g. , some patients may prefer in-person or technology-assisted clinical interactions ) . The primary and secondary language of the provider and patient may impact service delivery such that a telephone-based or in-person interpreter may be necessary . Finally , providing care through any technology-based delivery system will not be effective if you do not ensure availability of time and resources before offering contact , communication and care . You must be able to provide and maintain quality , consistent care for services to be effective . TIPS FOR CONDUCTING A TELEMENTAL HEALTH SESSION • Conduct a practice telesession before your first session with the patient . This will decrease the likelihood of equipment failure and allow you and the patient to become comfortable with the modality before the treatment session . Some facilities offer services that will conduct practice calls with patients before sessions with providers . • Look directly into the camera if you are conducting a video session , instead of at the patient ’ s image onscreen , to ensure good eye contact . • Pay attention to your surrounding background area , and remove anything that may be distracting on camera . • Wear plain clothing without busy patterns ( e. g. , plaid , geometric shapes ) or bright colors . • Obtain patient ’ s emergency contact information at the beginning of every telemental health session and keep this information readily available through the session duration . • Verify patient ’ s physical address/location at the beginning of each appointment and note any changes that occur during the session . You should also take note of local emergency service information in the locality of the patient . PLEASE NOTE : If you call 911 , you will be connected to emergency services where you are located . This can cause an unnecessary and potentially dangerous delay . OVERCOMING BARRIERS Providers who are unfamiliar with technology are often reluctant to provide psychotherapeutic interventions through technology-based modalities , due to fear of hampering the therapeutic alliance ( e. g. , communicating warmth , understanding , sensitivity , and empathy ) . Although specific challenges to providing telemental health services do exist ( see Table 6. 2 ) , both providers and mental health patients have observed the therapeutic alliance over distance-based technologies to be comparable with that of face-to-face clinical interactions.

Orienting the patient to therapy involves : • A discussion of the theory underlying brief CBT • A description of how the presenting problems can be conceptualized and treated with this approach • Education about the structure , format , and expectations of therapy Orientation for brief CBT involves a discussion of the focused and time-limited nature of the therapy , plus the provider ’ s rationale for selecting brief CBT to treat a particular problem . As noted in Module 1 , this rationale includes the strong research basis of brief CBT and the fact that it is an empirically supported treatment . Many patients have little , if any , exposure to psychotherapy other than examples in the popular media . Although media may be a good avenue for disseminating innovative treatment strategies and therapies , there is an abundance of misinformation that patients may be exposed to . Conveying the legitimate science of CBT in ways that your patients can understand may help build motivation for change during the therapeutic process as well as debunk previously misinformed perspectives . Providing patients with an understanding of the therapeutic process allows them to be more active and aware of their role in the progression of therapy . Knowledge of the process of brief CBT enhances the collaborative nature of therapy . When ? ( Indications/Contraindications ) Discussing the rationale for CBT and describing the process of therapy should occur in the first session . However , it is useful to revisit the model throughout treatment to expand upon the rationale for CBT skills . The explanation of the model can be tailored to the patient 's presenting problem , and examples to explain each component can be drawn from those generated in discussing problems specific to your patients ( e. g. , `` I ca n't seem to get out of bed , and then I feel worthless '' ) . For patients who think in concrete terms , it might be necessary to provide many examples and initially focus on behaviors rather than cognitions . 53 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 7 How ? ( Instructions/Handouts ) INTRODUCING THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL MODEL The cognitive behavioral model is a theoretical paradigm for explaining associations among thoughts , feelings , and behaviors . Most individuals believe that situations give rise to their emotions , as it may be easier to understand how intense emotional experiences occur in specific situations . However , the cognitive behavioral model suggests that thoughts we have about situations influence our behaviors and impact our emotions ( Figure 7. 1 ) . This perspective does not negate the impact of external/internal stimuli ( i. e. , situations ) on emotions , rather it facilitates a shift in perspective to facilitate the therapeutic process . For instance , individuals who are depressed or anxious tend to display patterns of unhelpful or “ inaccurate ” thinking . In the cognitive elements of CBT , the provider trains patients in specific skills that help them learn to improve their mood and change behavior by modifying the way they think about situations . Figure 7. 1 Cognitive Behavioral Model SITUATION THOUGHTS FEELINGS BEHAVIORS 54 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 7 INITIAL SESSION To prepare for the initial session , thoroughly review all intake information and use modules in this manual . You need the intake information to initially conceptualize and formulate a therapeutic plan . Using the patient ’ s presenting problems , symptoms , current level of functioning , culture , and history helps in developing the therapeutic plan . From the intake information , it is imperative that you assess the patient ’ s suicidality . This can be done by asking about the patient ’ s suicidal ideation , intent , or plan and determining his or her level of hopelessness , as well as the reasons for hopelessness . If the patient ’ s suicidality seems high , then crisis intervention is above all other therapeutic considerations . In the case of an acutely suicidal patient , seek supervision or consultation and follow approved clinic procedures for managing a suicidal patient ( e. g. , contact on-call psychiatrist for evaluation ) . Patient Expectations for Treatment You should inquire about what the patient knows about how therapy is conducted . Orienting your patient to therapy includes describing the cognitive-behavioral model and answering any questions he/she might have about the progression of therapy . Using the patient ’ s examples to help explain the cognitive-behavioral model will assist him/her in being able to see how the model can work and how it has worked for other patients with similar problems . Patients may confuse psychotherapy ( i. e. , typically uses Socratic dialogue , motivational enhancement strategies , and collaborative planning to foster patients ’ motivation for change to positively impact psychopathology ) with counseling ( i. e. , advice is given and the focus may not be reducing the contribution of cognitive-behavioral components on patients ’ problems ) . Further , patients often think therapy is a place where they will come and be lectured and told what to do , or a place to vent without a focus on behavior change . It is essential in brief CBT that the patient understands that therapy is a partnership between the provider and the patient , in which they work together so that the patient can better understand feelings and solve problems . Negotiating the amount of time the patient will need to be in therapy is also important . For brief CBT , patients typically attend weekly individual sessions for four to eight weeks . However , the amount of time in therapy and the number of days a week can be reassessed periodically and adjusted to meet the needs of the patient ( see Module 8 – Goal Setting ) . Discussing Symptoms and Diagnostic Issues with the Patient Most patients want to know how they have been diagnosed . Explain the disorder in terms of cognitive and behavioral symptoms to clarify how CBT will directly address their problems . Giving patients descriptions of common symptoms of their disorder can also be helpful . In-Session Example 7. 1 Example : There are cognitive and behavioral aspects of feeling depressed . Cognitive characteristics of depression include having negative thoughts about yourself , such as “ I am no good , ” or “ Things are not going to get better. ” Behavioral characteristics are ways your body tells you you ’ re depressed , such as changes in your appetite or sleep patterns . 55 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 7 Feedback The collaborative piece of CBT involves asking a patient for feedback on the session ( e. g. , “ What did you think about our session today ? Did we leave out anything you think is important to discuss ? ” ) and on how the patient feels about the cognitive-behavioral model ( e. g. , “ Do you feel you have at least a basic understanding of the model , or should we be sure to review it in detail again next week ? ” ) at the end of the first and subsequent sessions . Encouraging patients to offer feedback strengthens the rapport and trust within the therapeutic relationship and indicates to patients that they are active members of the therapeutic process . It shows that the provider cares about what patients think and feel and values their input . This is also a time to resolve misunderstandings about the cognitive model or things that occurred in the session ( e. g. , “ Was there anything that bothered you about the session , or anything that you ’ d like to change ? ” ) . Getting feedback from the patient shows how important it is to work as a team and helps you work on sharpening your abilities in therapy . It also allows you to attend to and repair any real or perceived therapeutic fissures or needed treatment modifications in a timely way .

New York : Guilford Press ; Chapter 5 . 57 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 8 Module 8 : Goal Setting OBJECTIVES • To understand the concept of goal setting in brief CBT • To acquire skills to set feasible and appropriate goals in brief CBT What is Goal Setting , and Why Is It Important To Set Goals in Therapy ? Goal setting is the process of collaboratively identifying specific therapeutic outcomes for treatment . Goals must be observable , measurable and achievable and relate to cognitive or behavioral changes relevant to the patient ’ s presenting problem . Goals are tied to specific skills to be addressed in treatment . Goals increase the continuity of sessions ; allow directed , focused treatment ; and enable the patient and provider to assess the progress of therapy and identify change in an objective manner . When ? ( Indications/Contraindications ) In addition to identifying the problem and building rapport , goal setting is one of the first therapeutic activities to be completed in brief CBT . Although goals can be changed/modified at any point during therapy , to maximize applicability and benefit to the patient , a preliminary set of goals should be established and agreed upon by the end of the first or second session . How ? ( Instructions/Handouts ) Goal setting begins with the identification of broad goals . These are global and refer to areas of functioning ( e. g. , family , work , social relationships , financial concerns , health ) . Broad goals are closely tied to your case conceptualization and the patient ’ s presenting problem . Once broad goals are identified collaboratively , you and the patient should prioritize goals . This process involves determining the most central issues that cause concern and arranging them from most important to least important . Starting with the problem that has the best chance of being solved and is central to the patient ’ s presenting concerns can help increase the patient ’ s commitment to therapy . If one skill is prerequisite to a subsequent goal , you can prioritize that goal in treatment ( e. g. , relaxation before exposure , awareness of thoughts before thought challenging ) . Use a graded approach to goals , in which you take small steps in service of the larger goal each week through session content or homework assignments . Identifying and sequencing action steps involve breaking each goal into smaller steps to help the patient know what to do at every stage of accomplishing the goal without feeling overwhelmed by a huge task . It is important to note that all patient concerns may not be attended to in a brief treatment format . 58 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 8 Once goals have been identified and prioritized , they are operationalized , which involves defining the goal and all the steps that it will take to achieve it in concrete , observable/measurable cognitive or behavioral terms . Another important process of brief CBT is ongoing measurement-based care ( MBC ) used to assess the progression of the patient ’ s symptoms throughout therapy . Use disorder-specific , validated self-report tools allowing patients to identify the degree specific symptoms contribute to their distress . This process informs baseline distress and end-of-treatment progress and identifies areas still requiring attention during therapy . You can administer self-report tools to patients during the first and last sessions and as frequently as each therapy session . Some gold-standard instruments are as follows : • Depression : Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 , 9 items ; PHQ-2 , 2 items ; Kroenke , Spitzer , & Williams , 2003 ) • Anxiety : Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 ( GAD-7 , 7 items ; GAD-2 , 2 items ; Spitzer , Kroenke , Williams , & Lowe , 2006 ) • Suicide : Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ; Posner et al. , 2010 ) • PTSD : PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 ( PCL-5 ; Weathers , Litz , Keane , Palmieri , Marx , & Schnurr , 2013 ) • Alcohol Use : Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption ( AUDIT-C ; Bush , Kivlahan , Mc Donnell , Fihn , & Bradley , 1998 ) • Drug Use : Drug Abuse Screening Test ( DAST-10 ; Skinner , 1982 ) In-Session Example 8. 1 Example Goal : Learn two cognitive and two behavioral strategies for coping with stress . 9 Operational Cognitive Goal • Learn and use thought testing and problem solving to manage anxious thoughts/situations . 9 Operational Behavioral Goal • Plan and complete one pleasant or social activity per week . ASSESSING FACILITATORS , BARRIERS , IMPORTANCE , AND CONFIDENCE Once a goal or multiple goals have been established , it is critical to assess the patient ’ s situation and attitudes about the goals . For example , ask whether there are aspects of the patient ’ s life that may facilitate or inhibit the goal . A strong family and social-support system may help a patient to reach a goal , but a functional limitation may create an obstacle . Explore facilitators and barriers and discuss strategies to maximize the chance of goal attainment . 59 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 8 Assessments of importance and confidence are also important . Ask the patients to rate the importance of the goal on a scale of 0 to 100 ( where 0 is not important and 100 is very important ) . Discuss ratings lower than 60 or so , and refine goals to increase meaning . Similarly , ask patients to rate their confidence in obtaining the goal . Here , confidence ratings could be a little lower but would , hopefully , increase as treatment progresses . TROUBLESHOOTING GOAL SETTING Some clues that goals may need modification are worsening symptoms , no change in symptoms , patient failure to complete homework ( see Module 10 : Homework ) , and patient/collateral report that the patient is not benefitting from treatment . In these cases , it is important to revisit initial goals with the patient and elicit feedback about the progress of therapy ( e. g. , “ What do you find helpful ? ” ) . Often , too-ambitious goals need to be modified . In these cases , it is important to frame the revision in terms of taking small steps towards lasting change , normalize the difficulty of making changes when depressed or anxious , and join the patient ( e. g. , “ I think I may have gotten a little ahead of myself ; let ’ s modify these a little , so that they can be the most help for you ” ; “ I may have missed the mark on this one ; what do you think about adding/changing/removing a goal ? ” ) . Goal revision should not imply to patients that they have failed in therapy . It is an opportunity to model functional change in response to changing situations . If a patient is worsening , discuss any changes in context ( e. g. , relationship , work , sleep , medication compliance , physical health ) the patient is experiencing . Create a new goal pertinent to what the patient believes is worsening and what might help . At this point , you should also consult a supervisor/colleague or other professional ( e. g. , patient ’ s treating physician ) . If patients are not improving , elicit their feedback about changes they are experiencing and their perceptions about why these changes have occurred . If a patient seems to have trouble understanding the assignments , focus on more concrete and behavioral skills .

Since we can ’ t really make someone do what we want , what could you do to help you feel heard or cope with a situation when you don ’ t feel heard ? ” • State Goals in a Positive Light . » This clarifies what patients want to do instead of highlighting what they don ’ t want to do . Example : “ List some things that you want , instead of things that you don ’ t want . For example , instead of ‘ I don ’ t want to be depressed anymore , ’ you could list , ‘ I want to enjoy my favorite hobbies again. ’ ” • Weigh Advantages and Disadvantages of a Goal . » This aids in understanding the costs and benefits of the patient ’ s achieving the goal . » It may be used to motivate an ambivalent patient or identify salient goals for a passive patient or a patient seeking to please the provider . Example : “ What would be the benefits if you accomplished this goal ?

In other words , it is usually not reasonable to try to do something every day ; and setting a goal like this will result in failure if the patient misses just one day . Alternatively , discuss the goal with the patient ; and start small . If patients succeed , they are more likely to remain actively engaged . Example : How often do you think it is reasonable to do something pleasant ?

Agenda setting is a collaborative process through which you and the patient decide how session time will be spent . You and the patient offer items you would like to discuss and then decide the order of items and the amount of time you will spend on each . Each item should serve a treatment goal ( see Module 8 : Goal Setting and Module 4 : Cognitive Behavioral Case Conceptualization and Treatment Planning ) . Agenda setting ensures that session time is well spent and that both provider and patient have input into session content . When ? ( Indications/Contraindications ) An agenda should be set within the first 10 minutes of every session . Without setting an agenda , it is very easy for vocal patients to “ run away ” with the session by recounting the events of the past week or describing the history of a problem . It is also easy for more passive patients to never indicate which items are most important to them . Collaboratively setting an agenda ensures that both your and the patient ’ s needs are met . Setting a time limit for each item increases the chance all items can be covered . Encourage patients to think between sessions about what they would like to discuss in session . If patients do not offer an agenda item , you can introduce an item and check with patients to see if they feel it would be valuable to discuss . How ? ( Instructions/Handouts ) It is your responsibility to model how to set agendas for the patient . In the first few sessions , you will be setting the agenda because often the patient is unsure of what is being asked or what to discuss in therapy . You can help patients become more comfortable with setting their own agenda by asking questions like , “ What is the main reason you came to therapy ? ” or “ What is causing you the most trouble right now ? ” or “ What are your most pressing issues today ? ” or “ What are your thoughts about the focus of today ’ s session ? ” It is also important to assist the patient in prioritizing issues on the agenda to give an acceptable amount of attention to each . After listing and prioritizing items , allot an approximate time to each item for discussion . In accordance with the collaborative process of psychotherapy , sometimes lower-priority patient or provider agenda items may need to be addressed at a later session ( i. e. , if it is not feasible to allocate adequate time for addressing said items during the current session ) . 63 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 9 Pay close attention to time management of issues on the agenda , and steer the patient away from superficial issues . As time passes , the responsibility of setting an agenda for the session should shift to patients . This will eventually help them to set agendas , prioritize problems , and suggest interventions for issues encountered after completing therapy . This level of increasing patient responsibility also translates into their overall functioning by increasing autonomy of functioning as they work toward ending treatment . Highlight 9. 1 Typical Session Outline 1 . Briefly review patient ’ s mood and/or physical functioning ( Five minutes ) . Elicit responses concerning the patient ’ s mood , and consider any and all discrepancies ( e. g. , change in strength or nature of usual mood , change from last week or beginning of treatment ) . Ask the patient to complete a self-report tool to measure symptom intensity and frequency . Medically ill patients may benefit from regular assessments and updates on their physical health symptoms and functioning . Also ask the patient to offer explanations for mood improvement or decline . This brief update allows you to gauge how the patient is progressing and identify positive and negative change . If medication management or physician collaboration is part of the patient ’ s treatment , this is also a good time to check on any side-effects the patient might be having from medication and make adjustments as needed . 2 . Bridge discussion from previous session with the current session ( Five minutes ) . In bridging sessions , you are checking the patient ’ s understanding of what was discussed in the previous session . Reinforcing what the patient learned in past sessions is essential to the improvement that the patient makes outside the therapeutic relationship . Having the patient complete a Bridging Worksheet can assist in this stage of the agenda . Some issues discussed during this phase could become items on the agenda for the current session . 3 . Set the agenda for the current session and prioritize the items ( Five minutes ) . First ask patients what they would like to discuss , and then offer an item . If patients bring several agenda items , they might need to indicate which is the most important to discuss first . When patients offer a situation as an item ( e. g. , fight with boyfriend followed by food binge ) , you can use the situation as part of their agenda item , that is , as part of the skill being taught . For example , you can use the above scenario to teach/review a thought record . 4. Review any homework given in the previous session ( Five to ten minutes ) . Patients who do between-session homework improve more than those who do not . To reinforce and troubleshoot between-session learning , it is important to review homework . In-session review serves two purposes : it reinforces the importance of homework and allows you to assess skill acquisition . If you identify errors in homework , you can use additional session time to review the skill . Reviewing 64 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 9 homework can take a small amount of time ; or it can take the entire session , depending on what patients have learned from doing it and what difficulties they have encountered in completing it . 5 . Discuss agenda items and set up homework ( 20-25 minutes ) . Discuss agenda items , starting with the first and most important . If you are running short on time , inform the patient that you will discuss the other items at your next appointment . Set up homework that is directly connected to what has been discussed in the session . 6 . Summarize the current session and exchange feedback ( Five minutes ) . Two types of summarizing are recommended . The first is a brief summary that should be done after the conclusion of each section of the agenda to reinforce what has been discussed . The second type is used to clarify and remind patients of the thoughts they have presented and how those thoughts changed as a result of the exercise . It is important to use patients ’ specific words in summarizing their thoughts . At the end of the session , summarize the main points of the entire session . As the sessions progress , ask patients to do the summaries . Finally , exchange feedback about the session , skill , or progress of therapy . This is a time for you to encourage and motivate patients to continue working towards change . TROUBLESHOOTING AGENDA SETTING In discussing agenda items , there are many pitfalls for a new CBT provider . It is your responsibility to keep the discussion on track and focused . To prevent unfocused discussion , gently guide patients back to the topic when they drift ; emphasize key emotions , beliefs , and automatic thoughts ; and often summarize and rephrase what patients say . You can also discuss at the start of therapy that one of your roles is to keep sessions on track ; so , you may , at times , need to shift the focus of conversation . Getting patients ’ agreement on this point at the beginning helps them feel more comfortable if you need to redirect or interrupt later in therapy . Pacing is also a concern for providers , but prioritizing and collaboratively agreeing on agenda items and times can help you and the patient stay within the allotted time . When guiding the conversation with your patient , you can use a mix of close-ended or open-ended questions in response to time constraints . Patients and providers sometimes have difficulty setting the agenda together . Sometimes patients do not want to contribute to the agenda because of feeling hopeless or negative toward therapy . Occasionally , the patient may also be unfocused when setting the agenda ( e. g. , recount events of past week ) . It is often necessary to educate the patient about therapy by clarifying what kinds of issues constitute agenda issues and how session time may be optimally spent . 65 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 9 CBT suggests that change involves skill acquisition and not simply identifying distorted thinking . Therefore , recognizing an unhelpful thought can be enlightening , but you should also use session time to teach skills to address the problem ( e. g. , thought records , behavioral activation ) and not simply discuss the issue with the patient or offer advice . The process of skill acquisition is what sets CBT apart from “ talk therapies ” ( supportive therapy ) . EXAMPLE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS 1 . Create an agenda for next session , using the given outline . 2 . Think about adjustments you would like to make to our current agenda and reasons why . 3 .

What did you learn from doing it ? 67 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 10 Module 10 : Homework OBJECTIVES • To understand how homework is introduced and used in brief CBT • To understand techniques for increasing homework utility and compliance What Is Homework , and Why Is It a Central Part of CBT ? Homework is an essential and effective component of brief CBT . Because of the condensed number of sessions in brief CBT , assignments such as readings , behavior monitoring , and practicing new skills should be given to the patient to practice and use outside sessions . Homework assignments facilitate patient skill acquisition , treatment compliance , and symptom reduction by integrating the concepts learned in sessions into daily life . Homework is a key mechanism for facilitating between-session work and progress . When ? ( Indications/Contraindications ) Give homework assignments throughout treatment . The nature and frequency of assignments are left to your discretion . Consider patient characteristics when assigning homework , specifically , reading ability , cognitive functioning , cultural identity , level of distress , work/life balance , and motivation . During the beginning stage of therapy , suggest homework ; but , as therapy progresses , encourage patients to generate their own between-session activities . This helps them to continue to use skills outside therapy and after the end of treatment . Some patients may be hesitant to participate in homework assignments , so it is your responsibility to be open to patient feedback about assignments , give reasons for each task , and personalize homework assignments for each patient . Also , patients may have a negative reaction to the word homework , which might prompt you to use practice or at-home exercises . How ? ( Instructions/Handouts ) SEVEN TIPS FOR SETTING HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS 1 . One Size Does Not Fit All . Always tailor assignments to patients . Their reading level ; desire to change ; cognitive functioning ; and , even , stage of life determine how much and what type of homework assignment fits them best . For example , a single , working mother who is also a full-time student may not have time to read a complete book as a bibliotherapy assignment . Assigning her a small part of the book or an article may be more reasonable . Breaking assignments down into smaller parts is also useful . Always consider the patient ’ s diagnosis and presenting problem when assigning homework and ask yourself : 68 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 10 In-Session Example 10. 1 “ Can the patient handle this homework , and will it be beneficial to his/her growth ? ” “ Could there be a negative result from this assignment ; and , if so , is the patient prepared to handle it outside session ? ” 2 . Explain in Detail . Knowing the reason for an assignment and how it relates to overall treatment goals help patients understand why they are doing the assignment and also may encourage him/her to complete it . Most patients are interested in how certain activities may improve their situation or relieve their symptoms . Explain assignments in the context of treatment goals and the cognitive model to enhance patient buy-in to the tasks . 3 . Set Homework as a Team . Involving patients in designing and scheduling homework increases the chances they will complete it . It is also important to get the patient ’ s agreement to complete the homework . Suggest homework assignments , and then ask the patient if you can help make adjustments to it . Ask , for example , the following : In-Session Example 10. 2 “ Do you think this is reasonable ? ” “ What would you change about the assignment ? ” “ Let ’ s do an example together first . Then we can make changes if we need to. ” 4 . Create a Win-Win Situation . Do not scold a patient for not completing homework assignments , but also do not dismiss their value . If a patient does not finish homework , which is common , you may learn about the patient ’ s level of motivation , ability to follow-through , or level of distress ( e. g. , too depressed to complete it ) . Failure to complete homework is an opportunity for you to evaluate the patient ’ s reason for noncompliance . The patient may have been anxious about completing an assignment incorrectly or may question the utility of the assignment . These thoughts are helpful to discuss in session . 5 . Start Homework In-Session . In the first few sessions after assigning homework , do a few examples with the patient in session , when possible . This gives the patient a clearer picture of what is expected and allows questions that he/she might have about the homework . It also gives the patient an idea how long the homework will take . In subsequent sessions , the patient may start the assignment with your assistance to troubleshoot questions about it . 69 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 10 6 . Ask About and Review Homework . To emphasize the importance of homework , always ask about and review homework the session after you assign it . If the patient did not complete homework , use session time , if possible , to complete the assignment , which may also help identify the aspects of the skill that need to be reviewed . If you do not review homework in session , patients may stop completing it . 7 . Anticipate and Prepare for Problems . With the first few homework assignments , help problem solve the assignment by eliciting feedback about it and planning when and how it will be completed . Assignments can be scheduled for a particular day and time to overcome barriers , and foreseeable problems for completing the assignment at that time can be discussed . For example , if the patient ’ s behavioral activation is to walk for 15 minutes on Wednesday at 4 pm , discuss what to do if it rains or other factors prevent completion . Agree upon and schedule a second option ( e. g. , using treadmill for 15 minutes ) . USING SELF-HELP RESOURCES AS HOMEWORK Assigning the patient reading materials relevant to brief CBT presenting problems is a useful tool for brief CBT because it allows patients to read about their disorder or CBT between sessions . This emphasizes the self-management focus of CBT and can accelerate therapeutic progress and maintenance of changes . Reading materials may be websites , book chapters , or sections of CBT patient manuals . Some common examples of CBT bibliotherapy are Mind Over Mood ( Greenberger & Padesky , 2016 ) and Feeling Good Handbook ( Burns , 1999 ) . HOMEWORK TROUBLESHOOTING Practical Problems Occasionally , providers may encounter a patient who waits until the day before a session to do the homework . This is problematic because certain assignments , such as monitoring automatic thoughts , are most effective and most accurate when completed in the moment . There are many reasons patients may put off doing homework ; and your role is to explore these reasons in a proactive , nonjudgmental , nonpunitive way . Sometimes patients may simply forget to do homework . They may have a busy schedule or have trouble remembering to complete homework . Using a calendar and scheduling time to do homework are useful in this situation and provide the opportunity for time-management skill building . You can also work with the patient to download self-management apps on his/her smartphone or tablets . A few assignments described in this text might be difficult for some patients . If a patient is having trouble completing an assignment because of the level of difficulty , it is your job to explain how to complete it and gauge the patient ’ s understanding . Some assignments may need to be broken down into smaller steps until the patient can fully grasp how it is to be completed . 70 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 10 Psychological Problems Patients who don ’ t complete homework might have unhelpful thoughts about themselves , the homework assignment , or therapy that need to be addressed . In these cases encouragement , thought testing , and listing the advantages and disadvantages of doing homework may be useful . Though outside the scope of this manual , techniques , such as motivational interviewing ( Rollnick , et al. , 1999 ) , may also be used to address the ambivalence a patient may feel about homework . Patient perceptions of importance and confidence are very important for noncompliance issues . Many patients have negative reactions to the word homework . They may feel overwhelmed by the perceived time or energy it will take to complete or concerned that therapy is like schoolwork . In giving homework , address any concerns the patient may have about time constraints ; and explain how long each assignment should take , while working with the patient to generate reasonable tasks . If the patient dislikes the term homework , work with them collaboratively to select another label , such as practice , between-session progress , task , or experiment . Homework may be problematic for patients who are perfectionists or those who desire to please the provider because they may spend too much time on an assignment or be overly concerned about getting the “ right answer. ” Clarify that the exercise is not about getting the “ right answer , ” and that they should concentrate on recording real feelings and thoughts and not concern themselves with spelling , grammar , or appearance of the assignment . Provider Homework Bias Although completion of homework is primarily the patient ’ s responsibility , sometimes your thoughts about an assignment or approach to homework play a role in noncompliance . Check your own thoughts about assigning homework , and determine whether there is anything you can adjust in your approach that could better encourage the patient . Ask yourself , “ Is the assignment too difficult ? , ” “ Did I explain the assignment thoroughly ? , ” or “ Have I led the patient to believe that homework is unimportant to therapy ? ” SAMPLE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS Examples of homework that could be assigned for each cognitive and behavioral skill are included in each module .

What Is Unhelpful Thinking , and Why Is It Important in Brief CBT ? The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that three layers of unhelpful thinking exist in individuals struggling with psychosocial difficulties : automatic thoughts , intermediate beliefs , and core beliefs ( depicted below in Figure 11. 1 ) . Figure 11. 1 Layers of Unhelpful Thinking Automatic Thought Intermediate Belief Core Belief 72 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 11 Automatic thoughts are immediate internal reactions that occur in response to situations and/or events . We are often unaware of automatic thoughts because of their almost instantaneous nature . Sometimes automatic thoughts are helpful , as they help us navigate our environments . However , automatic thoughts become unhelpful when they are attached to symptoms of psychopathology ( e. g. , social isolation , depression , anxiety , etc . ) and negatively impact people 's quality of life . One way that we gain insight about these automatic thoughts is by understanding our emotional reactions to them . Unhelpful thinking styles are distorted reflections of situations that are often accepted as true . In essence , these unhelpful thought styles are real-time manifestations of negative beliefs ( i. e. , about oneself , the world , and the future ) that are triggered by situations or exaggerated by psychiatric symptoms ( e. g. , anxiety or depression ) . Intermediate beliefs are attitudes or rules that a person follows in life that typically apply across situations ( not situation specific as with automatic thoughts ) . Intermediate beliefs can often be stated as conditional rules : “ If x , then y. ” For example , “ If I am thin , then I will be loved by others. ” Individuals create these assumptions by categorizing the information they receive from the world around them . These rules guide thoughts and subsequently influence behaviors . Core beliefs drive rules and automatic thoughts . For example , the belief , “ I am unlovable , ” may be driving the conditional rule , If I am thin , then I will be loved by others , which may drive obsessive thinking about one ’ s appearance , excessive exercise , or disordered eating habits . Core beliefs are often formed in childhood and solidified over time as a result of one ’ s perceptions of experiences . Because individuals with psychological disorders tend to store information consistent with negative beliefs but ignore evidence that contradicts them , core beliefs tend to be rigid and pervasive . Although automatic thoughts are often tied to a specific situational trigger , intermediate and core beliefs are more global and cut across domains . Individuals tend to have core beliefs that involve either interpersonal ( “ I ’ m unlovable ” ) or achievement issues ( “ I ’ m incompetent ” ) . When ? ( Indications/Contraindications ) Identifying unhelpful automatic thoughts is the first step in the cognitive component of therapy . The focus of intervention in brief CBT is the unhelpful automatic thought . Patients must master identifying and challenging thoughts to be able to grasp the concept and techniques of challenging beliefs . Because of the interrelated nature of thoughts and beliefs , an intervention targeting automatic thoughts may also change underlying beliefs ( depicted below ) . Therefore , brief CBT can result in belief modification , even if the target of treatment was automatic thoughts . 73 Figure 11. 2 Brief CBT and Unhelpful Thinking Because patients progress through treatment at different rates , you may be able to identify and challenge some beliefs late in brief therapy ( sessions 5-8 ) for some patients . For other patients , work will be limited to automatic thoughts . Highlight 11. 1 Because skill building to alleviate symptoms and prevent relapse is a central focus of CBT , mastery of skills is paramount . Focus on building a skill set with patients that they can generalize to different situations , thoughts , or beliefs . It is less important to identify and modify deep-seated childhood beliefs . For most patients in brief CBT , this will not be necessary for symptom reduction . However , some patients may benefit from this work . Although you may not discuss beliefs directly with patients , as part of the case conceptualization , they should constantly be forming hypotheses about what beliefs may be driving the thoughts ( see Module 4 : Case Conceptualization and Treatment Planning ) . In identifying thoughts and beliefs , ask yourself several questions . • Is the thought/belief secondary to another thought/belief ? • How much does the patient believe it ? • Does it affect the patient ’ s life negatively ? ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 11 Automatic Thought Intermediate Belief Core Belief 74• Is the patient prepared to work on it now , or should they tackle the belief later ? After an automatic thought or belief is identified , it is challenged using the skills in Module 11 How ? ( Instructions/Handouts ) EXPLAINING AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS TO YOUR PATIENT It is important for patients to understand he rationale for identifying automatic thoughts before gaining skills to address their own thoughts . Using the situation -- > thought -- > feeling triangle introduced in Module 7 ( Orienting the Patient to Brief CBT ) can be helpful in explaining automatic thoughts . Completing the triangle with the patients ’ recent or current automatic thoughts can facilitate their understanding . In-Session Example 11. 1 Provider : “ So , Pamela , how have you been feeling this week ? ” Patient : “ Just really sad…as usual . It seems like I ’ m always feeling that way. ” Provider : “ Did anything in particular trigger this sad feeling this weekend ? ” Patient : “ Yes , I had to go to my cousin ’ s wedding ; and it was really difficult because I started thinking about how I will never get married. ” Provider : “ Pamela , that ’ s what we call an automatic thought . It ’ s something that just pops into our heads over and over again without our really thinking about it or examining the truth of the thought . It affects the way we feel and act in a negative way . Maybe we should look at some of your automatic thoughts a little closer. ” Using the patient 's example , describe the association between thoughts and feelings to build awareness of the connection . This is a good time for the patient to write down the thought and begin using the cognitive-behavioral model ( Figure 11. 3 ) . In-Session Example 11. 2 Provider : “ So , let ’ s write down this automatic thought that you are having . I will never get married . Your going to your cousin ’ s wedding was the situation that triggered the thought , ‘ I will never get married. ’ ” Patient : “ Yes , that ’ s true. ” Provider : “ When you were at the wedding and that thought came to you , how did you feel ? ” Patient : “ I felt really sad and hopeless. ” ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 11 75 Provider : “ So , can you see how our thoughts can affect our mood and change the way we are feeling ? ” Pamela : “ Yeah , I guess if I hadn ’ t had that thought , I wouldn ’ t have felt so bad. ” Figure 11. 3 Example Patient Cognitive Model ELICITING AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS It is important for providers to teach patients how to identify automatic thoughts during and outside of session . AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS IN SESSION Be aware of patients ’ hot thoughts during sessions . Hot thoughts are automatic thoughts that occur in combination with a change in emotion or mood . Hot thoughts are particularly poignant or strong thoughts that are often associated with unhelpful core beliefs and should be targeted in therapy . Hot thoughts and the accompanying situation and emotion are tracked on the first three columns of the thought record ( see p. 81 ) . To identify which automatic thoughts are “ hot , ” listen for verbal cues , such as the language used in the thought ( see Cognitive Distortion worksheet , p. 83 ) , and watches nonverbal cues , such as increased volume of speech or fidgeting . Changes in facial expression , shifts in position , or hand movements can be helpful in determining whether a patient is experiencing an automatic hot thought . Listening to tone , pitch , volume , and the pace of a patient ’ s speech is also beneficial . When you notice these actions , this is an opportune time to bring it to the patient ’ s attention and assist them in identifying an automatic ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 11 THOUGHT “ I WILL NEVER GET MARRIED ” SITUATION COUSIN ’ S WEDDINGFEELING SAD/HOPELESS 76 thought associated with the shift in emotions . In these instances , you are simply an observer of the behavior and make a note of your observation to the patient ( “ You are speaking more loudly ; what is going through your mind right now ? ” ) . The patient then provides an explanation of the behavior . In-Session Example 11. 3 Patient “ My boss reprimanded me again yesterday ” ( sighs heavily . ) Provider : “ Tell me more. ” Patient : “ Well , we were at a meeting ; and I had just made my presentation , and he said he had expected a better product for the client. ” ( voice gets softer , beings wringing hands ) . Provider : “ Your voice changed a little when you said that ; tell me what is going through your mind right now ? ” Example continued : Patient : “ I just feel like a failure at everything . My work has always been the one thing I was good at , and now I am failing at that , too. ” Provider : “ Let ’ s take a look at that line of thinking and the feelings it creates . It seems that when that thought entered your mind , your mood changed very quickly . Did you notice that ? ” Patient : “ Yeah , I guess it did upset me pretty fast. ” You usually will also need to use specific questions to elicit an automatic hot thought . These questions are found in Module 12 . AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS BETWEEN SESSIONS In brief CBT , a principal characteristic is the work the patient does outside of session . Because identifying automatic thoughts is a novel concept to many , practicing outside of session will facilitate movement and change in therapy . In fact , Burns and Nolen-Hoeksema ( 1992 ) found that patients who completed homework had significantly better treatment outcomes than those who did not . Practicing key skills between sessions allows session time to be used for new skill acquisition and troubleshooting . Initially , when a specific situation is brought up in session , always ask , “ What was going through your mind at that moment ? ” This helps the patient build awareness of an automatic thought , both within and outside of session . ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 11 77 Because automatic thoughts may occur outside awareness , asking for a more detailed description of the situation is also helpful in pinpointing unhelpful thinking . For example , you could `` take the patient back '' to when it happened , using imagery ( e. g. , Where were you when this happened ? What time of day was it ? ) . If the patient reverts to past tense , remind them to tell the story in present tense to help bring back the thoughts and feelings that occurred in this situation . With continued questioning , it is possible that there may be more than one automatic thought associated with a problematic situation . Elicit and record all automatic thoughts given for a particular situation . In-Session Example 11. 4 Provider : “ Craig , what else were you thinking during this phone call with your wife ? ” Craig : “ I was thinking that she knows how bad I feel for not coming to the party and she wants me to feel even worse. ” Provider : “ So you weren ’ t thinking only that they were using you . You were also thinking that they knew you felt bad , and they wanted you to feel worse ? ” Craig : “ Yes. ” Provider : “ So , that is really three different thoughts that you were having that were creating feelings of anger ? ” Craig : “ I guess so. ” Remember that a patient ’ s automatic thoughts should be the actual words or images that go through their mind . Patients ( or providers ) may often interpret or rephrase thoughts ; however , the goal is to get unprocessed thoughts verbatim . DECIDING WHICH AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS TO FOCUS ON Once patients become aware of how many automatic thoughts they have , they may feel overwhelmed by their sheer number . Uncovering one thought may lead to another and so on . Therefore , it is important to focus on the most important automatic thoughts and the hot thoughts that are likely to bring about the greatest change . There are several things patients can do once they have identified an automatic thought . They can decide to focus on that thought , choose another thought associated with the situation , or move on to another topic if they feel that there is a more powerful thought that they would like to tackle . ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 11 78 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 11 You can help the patient choose automatic thoughts to focus on by frequently checking : • Goals for this session • Patient ’ s agenda items and addressing those problems • The importance of the thought chosen in reaching therapeutic goals Another technique is to identify a few automatic thoughts and then rate them on a scale of 0-100 , based on how intense the associated feeling is ( rate the feeling from 0-100 ) , and how much patient believes the thought ( rate believability from 0-100 ) . This helps to quantify which automatic thoughts are most important . The thoughts with the strongest ratings should be considered first . Unhelpful automatic thoughts often fall into certain categories . These are common '' cognitive distortions '' or thinking errors . Identifying patterns of cognitive distortions in the patient 's thought records or speech is instrumental for choosing a hot thought , conceptualizing the case , and planning treatment . A patient often has one or two common patterns of unhelpful thinking . Identifying these patterns helps him/her identify them when they come up and provides you an opportunity to intervene on a thought triggered in multiple situations . Therefore , changing a particular thought that is part of an unhelpful thinking pattern ( e. g. , tendency to ignore the positive ) may have multiple benefits for the patient . For a list of common thinking errors , see the Unhelpful Thinking Styles at the end of this module . INTERMEDIATE BELIEFS To identify an intermediate belief , you must first know how to recognize patients ’ automatic thoughts . You can do this by identifying an automatic thought and then attempting to identify an attitude or assumption patients feel about themselves , the future , others , or the world . These assumptions can be identified by listening for themes in the patient ’ s thoughts and behavior . You can use several techniques to identify an intermediate belief : • Look for an intermediate belief that comes in the form of a patient ’ s automatic thought . • Provide the first part of an assumption ( “ If x . . . ” ) , and enlist the help of the patient to complete it . • Elicit a rule or an attitude from the patient and change it into an assumption . • Look for themes in the patient ’ s automatic thoughts . Either come up with a hypothesis or ask the patient to identify a theme . • Ask patients directly about their beliefs . • Have patients complete a questionnaire or inventory that will help identify their beliefs . 79 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 11 CORE BELIEFS Throughout therapy , hypothesize core beliefs that may be underlying unhelpful behaviors and thoughts . These hypotheses aid development of the case conceptualization and treatment plan ( see Module 4 ) . A belief that is likely to be core will appear in several different areas of the patient ’ s life ( i. e. , relationships , work , parenting ) . If time permits in Brief CBT , after you have collected enough evidence to support the alleged core belief , present and discuss it with the patient . In-Session Example 11. 5 “ I ’ ve heard you say several times that you either didn ’ t do a good job , or that someone else put in more time and energy . It seems to me that you feel inadequate a lot of the time . Is that right ? ” At this point , you can elicit earlier life experiences consistent with the belief . This helps identify the possible origin of the belief and helps you explain it to the patient . In educating the patient about core beliefs , make several things clear : • Core beliefs are only ideas . Feeling them strongly does not make them true . • These beliefs started developing during childhood and are formed over time . Patients believe them today because they have stored evidence to support them and rejected evidence to contradict them . • These beliefs can be tested and changed through use of the techniques that will be taught in therapy . 80 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 11 EXAMPLE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS 1 .

Several techniques can be used to challenge unhelpful thinking . Most are used in conjunction with a thought record . Challenging thoughts and beliefs in a collaborative , Socratic way allows patients to use their own statements to counter unhelpful thinking . Generating counter-statements based on the data patients bring to session increases the believability of the thoughts/beliefs and , thus , the effectiveness of the counter thoughts/beliefs . When ? ( Indications/Contraindications ) Typically , unhelpful automatic thoughts are the first targets in the cognitive component of CBT . Following the introduction of the cognitive model ( see Module 7 : Orienting Patient to Brief CBT ) , and skills for identifying automatic hot thoughts and their accompanying emotions ( see Module 11 : Identifying Unhelpful Thoughts ) , introduce techniques for challenging hot thoughts . These techniques should immediately follow the session on identifying hot thoughts , to build continuity and familiarity with the skill set and instill hope of change after identifying problematic thinking patterns . Although intermediate and core beliefs will be challenged in advanced stages of therapy , the techniques are similar for challenging thoughts . Many techniques below can be used interchangeably for challenging thoughts or beliefs . Brief CBT session time is best used for modifying thoughts or beliefs that are tightly held and strongly believed . How ? ( Instructions/Handouts ) Socratic questioning is a provider stance for questioning unhelpful thinking . This process involves asking a series of open-ended , brief questions that guide patients to discover their idiosyncratic thoughts , feelings , or behaviors associated with a particular situation . Socratic questioning is nonjudgmental but is based on the provider ’ s insight that the original premise of a thought or belief may be untrue ; therefore , the questions are designed to expose the unhelpful thought or belief so that it may be challenged . The Thought Record is the staple of cognitive work in brief CBT . The first three columns ( see Thought Record handout at the end of Module 11 ) are used for identifying troubling situations and the accompanying emotions and unhelpful thoughts . These three columns are used in conjunction with Module 10 in that when the situation -- > thought -- > feeling triangle is unfolded , it forms the first three columns of a Thought Record . 85 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 12 A seven-column Thought Record is used to challenge unhelpful thoughts and beliefs . Instructions for completing columns 4-7 are described in detail below . Once a hot thought and its accompanying emotion have been identified and rated , the hot thought is questioned to generate evidence for and against it . Building evidence may be introduced in the following way : In-Session Example 12. 1 Example : We have identified a thought that is very powerful for you . You rated this thought as 90 out of 100 for sadness . Before spending a lot of time and energy on this thought , I want to know whether or not it is true . Often when people are depressed or anxious , they take thoughts like this at face value , without first asking whether they are true . Accepting thoughts like this as true would certainly lead to the symptoms you ’ ve been struggling with . If I thought , “ I am worthless and can ’ t do anything right , ” I wouldn ’ t want to get out of bed in the morning either , and I would probably feel pretty hopeless and sad . When we test a thought like this , we are going to generate evidence for and against the thought . It is as though the thought were on trial , and you were a lawyer for the case . Remember , you have to be able to prove the evidence you are generating . So , now let ’ s see how your thought stands up . . . . DEVELOPING BALANCED THINKING These instructions might be useful to help patients develop balanced thinking : 1 . Help the patient question automatic thoughts by asking : • What evidence is there that this thought is true ? • What evidence is there that this thought is not true ? • What would I tell someone I loved who was in this situation and had these thoughts ? • If my automatic thought is true , what is the worst that could happen ? • If my automatic thought is true , what is the best thing that could happen ? 2 . Once you and the patient have generated evidence , combine it to form a more balanced thought . This thought will likely be much longer and more nuanced than the original hot thought . In-Session Example 12. 2 Example : Taking all this information ( from columns 4-5 ) into consideration , what is a more balanced thought that more accurately reflects the facts ? 86 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 12 You might want to ask the following questions : • Taking the information into account , is there an alternative way of thinking about the situation ? • Can someone I trust understand this situation in a different way ? 3 . Rate the believability of the alternative thought between 0-100 % . If the thought is not more than 50 % believable , more work is needed to identify an alternative thought . Go back to the evidence and keep working . After the patient has generated an alternative thought , they should rate how much they believe the thought from 0-100 % ( 0 % = no belief at all , 100 % = greatest belief ) . If the alternative thought is not rated at more than 50 % , this may indicate that the patient has actually provided a more deeply rooted belief ( as opposed to an automatic thought ) as the initial automatic thought . It is important to recognize the difference between beliefs and automatic thoughts because patients have to be motivated to change their thinking during the cognitive restructuring process . This motivation to change is less likely to happen if patients don ’ t believe in the change that they are trying to make . 4 . Once a believable alternative thought is generated , re-rate the mood associated with the hot thought ( 0-100 % ) after reading the new thought . Reducing a thought/belief to a rating of 0 % is not a realistic goal . Instead , a reduction of 30-50 % often provides relief . Often patients will generate new emotions from the alternative thought . However , it is most important first to re-rate the old mood before generating new emotions . The same strategy of generating an alternative thought for an unhelpful thought is used when challenging a core belief . Once the belief is identified , the evidence is weighed , and a new more balanced belief is generated . Highlight 12. 1 Summary : Completing Thought Records 9 Identify situation and corresponding thoughts and feelings . 9 Identify unhelpful thinking styles in thoughts ( e. g. , all or none thinking ) . 9 Use Socratic questioning to identify hot thought . 9 Elicit and rate emotions associated with hot thought . 9 Rate believability of hot thought . 9 Generate evidence for and against hot thought . 9 Generate alternative thought from evidence . 9 Rate believability of alternative thought . 9 Re-rate emotion of hot thought that is elicited by alternative thought . 87 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 12 TROUBLESHOOTING THOUGHT/BELIEF MODIFICATION Some patients can see the benefits of doing a Thought Record immediately , but others might need to be motivated to be engaged . It is helpful to use positive reinforcement to praise the effort of completing a thought record , point out the sections completed correctly , and review skills for the sections completed incompletely or inaccurately . If a thought record is assigned for homework , it must always be reviewed during the subsequent session . Taking session time to review the thought record emphasizes its importance to the patient . Introducing the Thought Record as an “ experiment ” helps alleviate any performance anxiety the patient may have about completing it and may generate interest ( “ Give the thought record a try this week , and we ’ ll see how it works for you . Let me know next session how the experience to complete it was . That will help us decide whether or not this is a useful tool for you. ” ) Occasionally , a patient will show disinterest in doing the Thought Record or get tired of it after a while . For instances like this , there are other ways you can suggest that the patient can continue to attempt the Thought Record : • If a patient complains of never having time to do a Thought Record when certain situations occur , suggest that they carry a blank Thought Record in a wallet or purse . • Patients can use their cell phone to record Thought Records or voice/audio record their thoughts . • If a patient has done the Thought Record for a while and is becoming disinterested , suggest doing a “ mental ” Thought Record , since they are familiar with the process . • Suggest reading old Thought Record that have similar situations and automatic thoughts of their own . • The patient can verbally dictate a Thought Record to someone and have that person write it down . • Instruct the patient to incorporate completion of the Thought Record into their daily routine , either at the same time of day or in an easily accessible location . There will not always be an immediate change to a patient ’ s mood after a Thought Record is completed . It might be necessary to assess why there is no change . It could be attributed to the patient ’ s deeply rooted belief in the automatic thought , to an unchanged underlying core belief , or to additional automatic thoughts that have not been evaluated . It is necessary to ask : Why was there no mood change after completion of the Thought Record ? These other questions will also be helpful : • Have I described the situation in enough detail ? • Did I identify and rate the right moods ? • Is the thought I am testing an automatic thought ? • Do I believe an unhelpful core belief is driving this thought ? • Did I list multiple thoughts ? Do I need more information for each individual thought ? 88 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 12 • Is there a stronger automatic thought that I have not put in my Thought Record ? • Do I believe the alternative thought ? What other alternative thoughts are available ? If thought/belief testing is ineffective in reducing negative mood , you can also explore the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining a thought/belief . As we know , there are many disadvantages to negative beliefs we have , but there are also advantages . The patient ’ s perceptions of the advantages may be obstructing the change process . Understanding the function of the thought/belief for the patient may be useful in clarifying why certain thoughts/beliefs are resistant to modification . The provider should evaluate both the advantages and disadvantages of a patient ’ s assumptions and beliefs but , in doing so , work to diminish the advantages and highlight the disadvantages . Often , when working to modify thoughts and beliefs , the patient may find evidence that supports the negative belief instead of evidence that contradicts it . If there is a good amount of evidence to support that negative core belief , then problem solving , rather than thought testing , is an appropriate strategy ( see Module 15 ) . Highlight 12. 2 Seven Tips for Effective Thought Records 1 . You must have mastered the use of Thought Records before introducing it to patients . 2 . Reinforce and make sure that the patient believes in the cognitive model being used . 3 . Teach the Thought Record in two sections : ( 1 ) The first three columns ; Situation , Automatic thought ( s ) , and Emotion ( s ) , and ( 2 ) the last four columns ; Evidence for and against thought , Alternative response , and New rating of emotion . 4 . Use the patient ’ s exact words when recording thoughts and feelings . Working with thoughts verbatim preserves the emotions or personal meaning for each thought . 5 . The patient should be able to adequately complete the first three columns of the Thought Record before learning about the last four columns . 6 . Completing a Thought Record is a skill and , like other brief CBT skills , requires practice . Success depends on the patient ’ s understanding of the steps . Encourage the patient to take time with the skill and work through any frustration . 7 . If the patient is not collaborative in completing the Thought Record in session or does not complete Thought Record homework , it is possible that they might have automatic thoughts about this type of exercise . Ask the patient to create a Thought Record of the Thought Record experience 89 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 12 EXAMPLE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS 1 .

Behaviors represent the “ B ” in CBT interventions , and it is important that patients become aware of the connection between thoughts , emotions , and behaviors ( see Figure 13. 1 below ) . Patients may not be as aware of the impact that thoughts and emotions may have on their behaviors . For instance , helpful thoughts ( e. g. , “ Today is going to be a great day ” ) may be related to more positive emotions ( e. g. , happiness , excitement , etc . ) and subsequent behavioral engagement ( e. g. , socializing with others , completing meaningful activities , etc. ) . On the other hand , unhelpful thinking ( e. g. , “ My life will never get better ” ) may be linked to negative emotions ( e. g. , sadness , anxiety , frustration ) and avoidant behavioral coping ( e. g. , social isolation , not going to work or attending school , not attending important family events ) . Thoughts , emotions , and behaviors may influence each other at any given moment throughout the day , and this relationship is bidirectional . Figure 13. 1 Thoughts , Emotions , and Behaviors Helping patients understand the connection between what they do ( behavior ) , what they think , and how they feel can help them gain insight , increase motivation for change in therapy , and improve therapy outcomes . Just as it is important to understand how past experiences have impacted patients ’ problems , it is equally as important to focus on things patients can do now to change their emotional experiences as they move forward in life . However , it may be more difficult to influence behavioral change if patients are not aware of the connections between these three components of the cognitive-behavioral treatment model . THOUGHTS EMOTIONS BEHAVIORS 92 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 13 What Is Behavioral Activation , and Why Is It Important ? Behavioral activation includes a set of procedures and techniques aimed at increasing patient activity and access to reinforcing situations that improve mood and functioning . From this behavioral standpoint , depression , for example , contains a host of characteristics that function to maintain depressive affect ( e. g. , passivity , fatigue , feelings of hopelessness ) and decrease the chance of adaptive coping by increasing avoidance . The key here is that difficulty with mood often serves to increase avoidance of adaptive coping , including pleasant events , which help to alleviate and avoid depression . Re-introducing pleasant events ( one form of behavioral activation ) can serve to improve mood in many different ways - 1 ) reversing avoidance , 2 ) increasing physical activity , 3 ) increasing self-confidence and 4 ) increasing feelings of usefulness and purpose . An important point for providers : Behavioral activation ( alternatively referred to as increasing pleasant activities ) consists of a host of possible behaviors including , but not limited to : 1 . Reintroducing prior pleasant activities 2 . Introducing new pleasant activities 3 . Active coping or mastery activities ( e. g. , taking some form of behavioral action ) to alleviate or reduce a life stressor ; examples of active/behavioral coping that are not pleasant-event driven include Filing or getting taxes done Cleaning out a messy closet Calling an estranged family member The goal of active coping is to decrease stress through accomplishment or overcoming avoidance . When ? ( Indications/Contraindications ) Because of its relatively simple and straightforward approach , behavioral activation is a good technique for initial stages of treatment and can be highly effective for patients with limited insight into their difficulties . Activation is also easily measured ( e. g. , number , frequency , or duration of activities ) and , therefore , can be used to document and convey progress to patients ( e. g. , to increase treatment investment and improve patient self- confidence and influence over symptoms ) . Behavioral interventions are particularly powerful for depressed mood . Activation for depression generally serves to get the patient moving . Integrating pleasant activities can be effective in improving depressed mood . However , getting the patient to complete activities is key . Almost all behaviors that include physical activity , planning , or accomplishing tasks are appropriate here . 93 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 13 How ? ( Instructions/Handouts ) STEP # 1 : PROVIDE PATIENT WITH RATIONALE FOR BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION . It is important to educate the patient as to what behavioral activation is and how it can be useful for improving depression and anxiety . Let patients know that feeling a little down or having a bad day and not feeling well physically can make it more likely that they will stop doing many activities that used to be pleasurable . When this happens , patients can get into the habit of avoiding pleasant activities that might actually help them feel better . It is also important for patients to understand the connection between what they do and how they feel , both mentally and physically . You are encouraged to explain to patients that increasing activity and/or taking action , even when we do not feel like it , help us to feel better physically , as well as decrease depression . Provider : I would like to talk a little about what your day looked like yesterday . Walk me through your day ( e. g. , what did you do in the morning , afternoon , evening ) Patient : Well , in the morning I woke up at 10 am and ate breakfast . I watched TV until noon . Then I ate lunch . Around 2:30 I took a shower . At 3:00 I went for a walk with my dog . Provider : Okay , thanks . How did you feel in the morning ? Patient : Tired . I just couldn ’ t get motivated and did not want to do anything . I guess I was feeling sorry for myself – depressed , I guess . Provider : You say you were feeling depressed . If you had to rate that feeling on a scale of 0 to 100 ( 100 is worst depression ) what would you say your depression was ? Patient : 65. Provider : What about in the afternoon after your shower and walk ? How would you rate your depression ? Patient : 20. Provider : To what do you attribute this change in your depression ? Patient : I guess I just got off my couch and started moving , which helped me feel better . Provider : That would be my guess as well . ( Subsequently , explain the connections between mood and behavior and encourage use of behavioral activation ) . 94 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 13 The figure below visually describes the connection between mood and behavior and can be an effective aid in communicating with patients . To maximize the utility of Figures 13. 2 and 13. 3 , you are encouraged to use the patient 's own examples . For example , you and the patient can work together to complete a daily activity log ( see handout ) . From this activity log , you might highlight activities that appeared to raise or lower the patient 's mood . Figure 13. 2 Lowered Mood and Behavior For depressed persons , increasing their activities daily improves mood and decreases symptoms of depression . Figure 13. 3 Improved Mood and Behavior Lowered mood Improved mood Decreased Pleasant Activities Increased Pleasant Activities Decreased Overall Activity Level Increased Activity Level 95 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 13 STEP # 2 : IDENTIFY BEHAVIORS – DISCUSS ACTIVITIES . Identification of potential activities begins by exploring with the patient activities that would be most meaningful . This may begin by having a general discussion about values that are important to the patient as well as goals that they may want to accomplish . Values clarification ( i. e. , identifying the most important things to patients ) can help patients feel heard and convey the collaborative process of the therapeutic relationship . Explicitly identifying values may enhance a patient ’ s motivation to change and guide the identification of behaviors that the patient would be willing to engage in related to his/her values . Additionally , a patient ’ s values can help identify therapeutic goals to incorporate into the treatment plan . Exploring targets for behavioral activation may begin with asking patients about 1 ) the types of things they would like to do but have not been able to do , or 2 ) activities they already do but would like to do more often . It may be important to anchor these behaviors within the context of values or goals that are important to them . You might want to ask if there is something that they need to do that they have been unable to do or have been avoiding . Although you want patients to do activities that are purely pleasurable to elicit positive mood , some patients may want to accomplish something rather than focus on doing something pleasant . Possible questions might include : • “ Can you think of any activities or hobbies that you used to enjoy doing but have now stopped doing ? ” • “ Can you think of any activities or hobbies that you would like to do but have never done ? • “ Are there things in your life that you would like to change ? If so , what would you like to do about these issues that you have previously not done ? ” For patients who have difficulty identifying activities , you can introduce a behavioral activity checklist ( see Appendix ) . Before completing the next steps ( e. g. , setting a plan ) , it is important to discuss the potential importance of the behavior with the patient . If he/she reports low importance , encourage the patient to find another , more meaningful activity . STEP # 3 : SET AN ACTION PLAN . Once the patient has identified a meaningful activity to engage in , help shape this work into a meaningful therapeutic goal . Action plans are one mechanism for creating meaningful behavioral goals for therapy . Action plans in their most basic form stipulate the specific goal to be accomplished , defined in terms of observable and measurable characteristics and a timeframe for monitoring progress . 96 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 13 In-Session Example 13. 1 Example : Goal : To read at least three times per week ( a minimum of 30 minutes per reading session ) Timeframe : Patient will complete three reading sessions over the next week . An expanded action plan might also include : a . Additional details of the plan – e. g. , how the goal will be obtained b . Possible barriers to reaching the goal and ways to address barriers if they arise c. Possible facilitators of obtaining the goal , e. g. , important people or situations that might aid the patient d. Patient ’ s confidence in reaching the goal in the timeline established ; if confidence is low , you might wish to alter the plan to increase chances of success . e. Skills that the patient might want to enlist to help reach the goal ( e. g. , relaxation skills , problem-solving skills , etc . ) STEP # 4 : MONITOR PROGRESS IN MOOD , MASTERY , AND CONFIDENCE . It is important to monitor the patient ’ s mood and feelings of mastery and confidence . Outcomes such as improvement in mood , mastery , or confidence can be best identified through homework assignments that ask the patient to document the frequency and use of the behavioral activity and any corresponding emotions or feelings of mastery or confidence . On the basis of this monitoring of outcomes , evaluate the action plan and the patient ’ s ability to work towards achieving goals . If problems arise , make changes accordingly ( e. g. , breaking down goals into smaller steps , determining patient perceptions of importance and changing goals accordingly ) . Monitoring shows the patient that you continue to believe in the importance of the technique/exercise and also serves to further motivate many patients by increasing the effectiveness of the intervention . TIPS FOR MANAGING BARRIERS TO DOING ACTIVITIES 1 . Help the patient break down more difficult activities into smaller steps . Look for alternative behaviors to accomplish a goal prohibited by a chronic illness , environmental stressors , or depressed mood . For example , a structural/mechanical engineer who was forced to retire because of a physical limitation may feel that life is no longer productive . Although the patient is physically unable to fulfill prior job duties , you can work with them to identify meaningful activities related to the prior occupation . In this case , the patient might benefit from volunteering at a university ; providing consultation ( e. g. , over email or telephone calls ) ; or volunteering for a local school , youth or church organization ( e. g. , talking about engineering ) . 97 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 13 2 . It is also helpful and supportive to look for ways to help with behavioral activation . Family or other social networks that the patient has not yet fully engaged might exist , which might assist the patient in moving forward on goals . The patient can also download smartphone applications that help with planning activities and that send reminders . 3 . Pleasant activities are the best first step . Pleasant activities are doubly beneficial to the patient , as they increase activity and feelings of pleasure . Activities designed to overcome avoidance or increase a sense of accomplishment should be entertained as the first goals only if highly important to the patient or apparently salient to the attainment of future goals . Highlight 13. 1 Summary of Steps Step 1 . Introduce behavioral activation and its potential influence to the patient. Step 2 . Use patient examples to show relationship between mood and behavior. Step 3 . Identify pleasant activities/active-coping behaviors. Step 4 . Set an action plan. Step 5 . Monitor progress . 4 . It is important to monitor anxiety and avoid behavioral activation procedures that further aid in the patient ’ s avoidance of fearful situations ( e. g. , presenting problem is avoiding interpersonal difficulties with spouse , and patient chooses to shop or be on the internet for pleasure but specifically when spouse is in the house to avoid confrontation/talking about issues ) . The goal is to introduce behaviors that will facilitate improvements in the patient ’ s life , while not reinforcing avoidance of uncomfortable situations and emotions . For example , patients with anxiety symptoms often avoid situations out of fear of negative consequence occurring in response to engaging in a particular activity . Although behavioral activation can aid these patients , you must also understand that the activity itself is not reinforcing ( pleasant ) but rather feared . It is only the resulting completion of the task that may generate positive affect ( e. g. , I faced my fear , and nothing terrible happened ) . This response differs from depression in that depressed patients will often look at behavioral activation as a positive outcome in and of itself ( e. g. , `` exercising is enjoyable , '' or `` I love talking with my granddaughter '' ) .

Exposure therapy is an approach commonly used to treat anxiety conditions ( namely , panic , agoraphobia , social phobia , and specific phobias – such as animals , heights , flying , choking , and blood-injury-injection ) . Exposure therapy is defined by its systematic approach to confronting feared stimuli in the presence of a safe environment . Feared stimuli can be external ( e. g. , objects , activities , situations ) or internal ( e. g. , feared thoughts , physical sensations ) . The aim of exposure therapy is to reduce the patient ’ s anxiety response to feared stimuli and increase the patient ’ s ability to experience and tolerate anxiety . The process includes creating a thoughtfully constructed hierarchy of feared stimuli organized by the patient ’ s reported degree of fear . The patient and provider systematically work their way up the hierarchy by exposing the patient to the feared stimuli with a variety of exposure exercises , allowing the patient to habituate to their anxiety over time . Exposure therapy is rooted in classical conditioning theory , which posits that fear , an emotion , becomes linked with previously neutral or unfeared stimuli through cognitive and emotional processes that result in associated symptoms of anxiety . Subsequently , anxiety becomes a conditioned behavioral response to these stimuli through the activation of fear and engagement in avoidance/escape behaviors . It is important to note that these previously neutral stimuli may be animate ( e. g. , spiders , clowns , people ) , inanimate ( e. g. , toilets , knives , numbers , places ) , situational ( e. g. , driving , darkness , feeling uncertain ) , cognitive ( e. g. , “ impure ” thoughts , memories of traumatic events , premonitions ) , or physiological ( e. g. , racing heart , feeling out of breath , flushed skin ) and would not otherwise elicit a strong or intense fear response . Exposure therapy seeks to “ undo ” this prior associative learning by reducing the conditioned anxiety/fear response through repeated confrontation with the feared stimuli . Most importantly , the individual undergoing exposure therapy must learn to tolerate the fear while building self-efficacy within the context of processing emotional reactions ( see Figure 14. 1 ) . 101 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 14 Figure 14. 1 . Breaking the cycle of anxiety ELEMENTS OF EXPOSURE Exposure therapy , typically delivered in 8 to 12 sessions in specialty mental health settings , is efficacious for anxiety disorders as well as other conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ; Hofmann & Smits , 2008 ; Rauch , et al . 2012 ) . Although exposure therapy requires adequate time for extinction , recent advances in treatment have shown that briefer formats of exposure therapy ( e. g. , four to six sessions ) are effective for patients with anxiety and PTSD ( Cigrang , et al . 2017 ) . Exposure therapy is generally conducted using one or a combination of different types of exposure exercises : • Imaginal exposure , or exposure to one ’ s own thoughts and mental images , may be used to help patients experience their most feared thoughts more fully . Sometimes , imaginal exposure may be used as a first step toward a strongly feared in vivo exercise . An example of an imaginal exposure is to have patients write a short story in which the things they fear the most eventually come true . • Interoceptive exposure , or exposure to physiologic sensations associated with anxiety and panic symptoms , should be used to systematically “ expose ” patients to the most common somatic symptoms associated with their fear responses . This should be done in a controlled way to ensure the health and safety of the patient . Interoceptive exercises may include simulation exercises and naturalistic activities to help patients increase their tolerance of physiologic bodily sensations without using safety behaviors . • In vivo exposure , or real-life exposure to feared objects or situations , may be used to help patients overcome anxiety and panic insomuch as they negatively impact their quality of life . In-vivo exposure is associated with reduced symptoms of anxiety and panic , PTSD , and OCD over the long term . Reversing the vicious cycle of anxiety The vicious cycle of anxiety Anxiety Long Term : Increase in the physical symptoms of anxiety , more worry , loss of confidence about coping , increased use of safety beha viours Increased scanning for danger , physical symptoms intensify , attention narrows and shifts to self Escape or avoidance Short term : Relief Confront feared situations without aid of safety behaviours situation Greater belief in ability to control own responses Short term slight increase in anxiety , then a decrease in physical symptoms and attention scanning Use of coping skills , anxiety reduces to manageable level 102 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 14 Table 14. 1 lists common terms and elements often associated with exposure therapy . Table 14. 1 . Common Terms in Exposure Therapy Emotional Processing The use of reflection to assist in the development of new , more realistic beliefs about feared objects , activities , or situations . Believed to be one of the critical active ingredients of exposure therapy . Extinction Weakening or removing previously learned associations between feared objects , activities or situations , and bad outcomes . Fear vs. Anxiety Fear -- the emotional and cognitive response to an object or situation of concern . Anxiety -- the constellation of symptoms that manifest when a feared response occurs . Flooding Starting exposure with the most difficult tasks of the fear hierarchy . Graded exposure The use of a fear hierarchy to systematically and gradually expose an individual to increasingly distressing objects , situations , or activities . Habituation Decreasing the intensity of anxiety reactions to feared objects or situations over time through repeated exposure . Panic Sudden uncontrollable fear or anxiety that often involves psychological and biological ( bodily sensations ) reactions . Within exposure therapy , fear associated with bodily sensations decreased by building tolerance to the sensation during exposure exercises . Safety Behaviors Behaviors used by patients to tolerate or reduce fear and , thus , avoid exposure to the feared object or situation . During exposure work , important to monitor and avoid safety behaviors during exposure exercises . Ultimate goal of exposure therapy : to translate skills into real-world situations ; important to help patients minimize use of safety behaviors in their daily lives . Stress Stress -- the way in which the body responds to any demand or challenge . Experienced daily by everyone . Importantly , not all stress bad but long-term stress harmful to health . SUDs Subjective units of distress . Commonly used to “ quantify ” levels of perceived stress . Typically used on a 0-100 scale . Systematic desensitization Combining exposure with relaxation exercises to make them more manageable . However , pairing with relaxation may interfere with the exposure experience . Must be monitored accordingly . Relaxation techniques possibly best used after the exposure exercise is completed . Worry A state of anxiety and uncertainty over actual or potential problems . Usually related to something impending or anticipated . 103 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 14 SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ELEMENTS IN EXPOSURE THERAPY • Identification and articulation of the specific feared objects , activities , and situations , as well as the associated anxiety symptoms ( for monitoring and fear hierarchy construction ) . • Development of comprehensive fear hierarchy . • Selecting feasible and clear exposure exercises . Ideally , should occur through in-vivo exercises and include attention to interoceptive experiences . • The goal of exposure to increase tolerance of panic/anxiety during exposure exercises . • Emotional processing of the exposure exercise to develop more accurate thoughts about the relationship between the feared object/activity and negative outcomes . When ? ( Indications/Contraindications ) Ultimately , you should use your clinical judgment and the most current empirical literature to determine the most appropriate course of treatment when considering exposure therapy as an option . The information contained in this module provides an overview and basic strategies for using an exposure-based approach in a brief setting . However , these basic strategies may not be appropriate for specialty mental health settings dealing with more complicated presentations . Because brief approaches to psychotherapy are not appropriate for all clinical presentations , we encourage providers to use specific ( and often more intensive ) treatment protocols when facing more severe or complicated clinical presentations of anxiety . For patients with less severe symptoms or when full protocols are simply not feasible – providers may consider the techniques in this chapter – while recognizing the potential limitations . Exposure interventions require appropriate provider technical expertise and adequate time for learning , reflection , and extinction of fear responses . Clinical situations in which these ingredients are not present should be approached carefully or with additional supports/alternatives . For example , most brief exposure-based protocols require four to six sessions , at minimum . GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR BRIEF COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY : 1 . Exposure therapy is an emotionally intense experience for patients and may lead to avoidance of therapy to avoid exposure exercises . Exposure should be graded and based on the patient ’ s presenting fear and fear hierarchy ( explained later in this chapter ) . 2 . Technical expertise on the part of the provider is required . Homework and in-session exposures must be done accurately , effectively , and efficiently ( e. g. , detailed hierarchies and appropriately targeted interventions ) to avoid unnecessary negative patient experiences . 3 . If you are unfamiliar with exposure principles , consult with other providers and/or receive supervision for initial or complex cases . 104 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 14 4 . Consider medication referral ( e. g. , antidepressants or benzodiazepine ) with an awareness that medications may serve to increase feelings of safety ( e. g. , safety behaviors ) and could compromise exposure-therapy impact if used to reduce anxiety during exposure sessions . How ? ( Instructions/Handouts ) EXPOSURE PROCESSES The process of conducting exposure-based brief CBT follows a general framework ( Barlow and Craske , 2007 ) : 1 . Psychoeducation : a ) provision of information and education about fear and physiological sensations and b ) instruction in how to self-record and track fear responses , using a “ scientific approach ” 2 . Teaching Coping Skills : a ) cognitive restructuring or threat forecasting to challenge myths or unhelpful thinking styles associated with fear and b ) breathing skills training 3 . Exposure Exercises : a ) repeated and graded exposure to situations in which fear or physiological sensations are anticipated 4 . Planning for the Future : a ) discussions about symptom return and relapse prevention . INITIAL STEPS : BUILDING THE FOUNDATION Assessment and Psychoeducation Initial steps should focus on gathering information about patients ’ symptoms , feelings , thoughts , and behaviors regarding the feared stimulus . Specifically , you need to clearly understand factors associated with the onset and maintenance of symptoms ( i. e. , precipitating circumstances , symptom duration ) , as well as alleviating or exacerbating factors . Figure 14. 2 is an example of how to assess for this information . 105 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 14 Figure 14. 2 . Example Anxiety Assessment Handout Psychoeducation is critical to provide an accurate foundation about fear and to help avoid misunderstandings . You should provide the patient with a comprehensive understanding of the fear response , including symptoms related to fear responses , mechanisms that maintain symptoms , and common myths associated with exposure treatment ( see Table 14. 2 ) . Symptom monitoring , a foundation for symptom management in CBT , should be introduced through structured worksheets and exercises. Physical Signs : How does your body react to worry/stress ? [ ] Muscle tension [ ] Rapid pulse [ ] Shortness of breath [ ] Butterflies in stomach [ ] Shaking/trembling [ ] Sweating [ ] Other : Thoughts : What is running through your mind ( including areas of concern ) ? [ ] Health ( own and others ’ ) [ ] Finances [ ] Issues related to aging [ ] Family/friends [ ] Daily events [ ] Work/volunteer [ ] Other : Behaviors : What actions do you take to reduce worry/stress ( e. g. , such as avoiding feared situations or doing something over and over ) ? Avoidance [ ] Not making decisions [ ] Avoidance of activities [ ] Procrastination [ ] Ignoring [ ] Other : Doing too much [ ] Checking [ ] Smoking [ ] Snacking [ ] Cleaning [ ] Asking for reassurance [ ] Other : 106 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 14 Table 14. 2 . Common Myths Related to Fear and Exposure Introduction to Exposure Treatment Actively inform your patients about the nature of exposure treatment ( e. g. , in-vivo , imaginal , or interoceptive exposures ) and a rationale behind the approach . It is important to communicate that exposure exercises will be done gradually , in a predictable manner , safely , and under your control as the provider . Exposure therapy yields positive outcomes when done correctly and when the patient understands the rationale . Often , patients may feel that exposure therapy is daunting or overwhelming . Regularly check-in with patients before and during the process to ensure that patients display high levels of self-efficacy to complete the exposure process . You should refer to other modules in this guide outlining other skills to address concerns that may impede success with exposure therapy ( i. e. , cognitive restructuring , relaxation ) . Receiving benefits from exposure therapy requires continued practice in-session and between sessions . The more the patient can complete exposure exercises , the more their fear will begin to decrease . Habituating to fear is a learned process that has to be reinforced over time . You and your patient will practice exposure in session , but the patient will have to practice exposure exercises three to four times each week , depending on the activity . Myth Fact Anxiety is not very common . People with anxiety are weak. Nearly one in five people experiences some type of anxiety disorder in any given year . Anxiety and stress happen to us all . Anxiety will get better over time if you just leave things alone. Anxiety and fear lead to avoidance , which maintains the response over time . Exposure and facing fears and anxiety are effective at reducing anxiety and fear . Therapy for anxiety will take years. Most anxiety conditions can be treated effectively in 10-12 weekly sessions . Anxiety reductions can often be seen within the first weeks of therapy , and some providers offer abbreviated treatment that involve four to six sessions . A panic attack can make you lose control or pass out . Fainting usually occurs from a sudden decrease in blood pressure and is not associated with panic attacks . Someone with anxiety should avoid situations that cause stress. Avoiding stress often leads to immediate reductions in anxiety but creates a host of additional problems , including avoidance and continued fear responses . Often , what feels natural ( e. g. , avoiding stress ) actually turns out to maintain or make anxiety worse . 107 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 14 Collaboratively Building a Fear Hierarchy Collaboratively building a hierarchy of feared situations and formulating a treatment plan are critical steps for exposure . Leverage your patient ’ s daily symptom recordings ( e. g. , panic attack records , daily mood ratings , avoidance of stimuli reports ) to facilitate a comprehensive fear hierarchy . The patient can use levels of anxiety , distress , or panic to identify a list of feared situations , animals , objects , or sensations . The patient should account or track distress over a period of time or use historical evidence to begin forming the hierarchy . You and your patient will work together to decide target stimuli for the exposure exercises in treatment , based on the patient ’ s presenting concerns , reported symptoms and case conceptualization . Once stimuli are chosen , work with the patient to create specific and detailed targets to base exposure exercises on , ranked by SUD ( subjective units of distress ) levels . These targets should be detailed enough for you to create an exposure exercise tailored to the patient ’ s fear . You should work to understand why the patient fears certain stimuli . For example , a patient may fear and avoid going to grocery stores . The fear could be because the patient has social anxiety and fears embarrassment . Or , the patient could fear having a panic attack in the middle of the store in front of others and not being able to escape . As part of the construction of the fear hierarchy , you must also attend to patient safety behaviors that contribute to the maintenance of anxiety and may undermine future exposure exercises . Figure 14. 3 . Example Hierarchy Targeted avoidance behavior : Avoiding grocery stores with too many people MORE DIFFICULT EASIERBuying a full list of groceries at the store by myself around 6 pm Buying multiple items at the grocery store in the longest line at 6 pm Buying one item in the grocery store around 6 pm after 10 minutes Walking around the grocery store for 10 minutes by myself around 6 pm Walking around the grocery store by myself around 11 am Walking around the grocery store for 10 minutes with a friend around 6 pm 108 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 14 INTERMEDIATE STEPS : EFFICIENT USE OF EXPOSURE An exposure activity is essentially broken into a series of seven steps . Exposure starts with a low-level feared exercise according to the fear hierarchy to prevent inducing a response too high for the patient to cope with and to increase the likelihood of the patient ’ s habituating to the response . Providers should ensure that safety behaviors are accounted for and monitored during the exposure exercise . Before and after the exposure , collect fear/anxiety symptom ratings as well as the patient ’ s cognitive and emotional response to the exercise to correct unhelpful thinking or behaviors , and commend the patient for completing the activity . Following successful completion of the exercise , work collaboratively with your patient to move up the fear hierarchy until symptom remission is attained . Repeated practice is critical for symptom remission . Treatment Duration and Frequency Exposure sessions may vary in terms of duration and temporal spacing as well as the level of involvement of the provider and/or significant others . Duration of treatment may be short or longer term . Shorter durations may include single sessions or abbreviated/weekend treatments , but such work often uses longer sessions and may be facilitated through delivery in group settings where interpersonal learning is possible between patients . Temporal spacing of sessions may include the traditional one session per week over a period of four to six weeks ( or more ) but may also be spaced such that exposure is heavily weighted at the beginning—with high levels of provider involvement—and then tapered into less frequent sessions ( greater spacing between sessions ) and/or less involvement of the provider . An exposure exercise is typically completed in session , and then the patient is instructed to complete more exercises at home . The exercise consists of a series of trials . Each trial consists of the same level of exposure to the fear stimuli , over a period of time , within the same time frame . For example , the patient may complete 10 trials of sitting in a dark room for 20-second intervals within 15 minutes total . Or , the patient may read an imaginal exposure script you both created three times during 15 minutes . Ultimately , by you in collaboration with patients in terms of their needs and preferences of the patient . Attention to Safety Behaviors Critical processes for exposure therapy require interoceptive and in vivo exposure as well as careful attention to the restriction of safety behaviors that undermine the exposure activity . Exposure requires that a patient tolerate and accept anxiety and fear rather than avoid it through compensatory strategies . For example , the goal of an exposure exercise is to learn to tolerate the distress associated with the feared stimulus . Other CBT skills such as cognitive restructuring and relaxation skills should not be used during an exposure exercise , as they can serve as “ distractions ” and may reduce the experience of the exposure itself , serving only to prolong or solidify the fear . Additionally , the use of anti-anxiety medications ( e. g. , benzodiazepines ) has been found to complicate and even negatively impact treatment outcomes both immediately and over time . 109 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 14 More examples of safety behaviors : • A patient who goes to the grocery store only with a friend so the friend can stand in the long lines . • A patient who sits closest to the exit during meetings in case of a panic attack and they need to get out quickly . • A patient who carries paper towels in case they start sweating in front of others . Steps of Exposure Exercise : 1 . Choose exposure activity ( e. g. , interoceptive exposure , in-vivo exposure , imaginal exposure ) a. Imaginal exposure i . Goal : Indirectly increase tolerance of a feared object or situation to allow a corrective learning experience through vivid imagination . ii . You choose this exercise when real-life exposure to that feared stimuli is not feasible or would be too intense for the patient to do at that time . iii . Imaginal exposure consists of you and your patient writing a detailed scenario of the feared stimuli , in first person . The scenario should include vivid details that tap into the patient ’ s specific fears and include the worst possible outcome of the feared situation . The patient reads the script completely as one trial of the exposure . iv . Examples : Imagining standing on top of a skyscraper , imagining talking to a friend , imagining a traumatic experience from the past , imagining taking a plane ride , or imagining not locking the house door b. Interoceptive exposure i . Goal : Increase tolerance of a feared bodily sensation or physical response to allow a corrective learning experience . ii . You would choose interoceptive exposures when the feared stimulus is experiencing a bodily sensation . The patient will build tolerance to a specific sensation with repeated exposure over time . In Session Example 14. 1 Feared Sensation Exposure Activity Racing heart Jumping jacks , running in place , push-ups Dizziness Shaking head , chair spinning , twirling in place Shortness of breath Straw breathing , voluntary hyperventilation , stair climbing Derealization/dissociation Staring at self in a mirror , voluntary hyperventilation , staring at a fixed point on the wall 110 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 14 c. In vivo exposure i . Goal : Directly increase tolerance of a feared object or situation to allow a corrective learning experience in real life . ii . Choose this type of exposure when the patient is ready to build tolerance in situations that are accessible in real life . These exposures can be conducted during the session but often will be planned for the patient to complete in between sessions . iii . Examples : Staying on an elevator , remaining in dark environments , being surrounded in crowds , purposely standing in long lines , holding a snake , touching a spider , giving a speech in front of an audience , or talking to a stranger 2 . Monitor safety behaviors . a . It is important to help patients understand safety behaviors ( i. e. , overt behavioral or covert internal thoughts and beliefs ) and signals ( i. e. , internal or external cues of safety ) as an unhelpful part of their fear response that maintains their symptoms . 2 . Assess for anticipatory anxiety subjective units of distress ( SUDs ) . a . It is important to help patients understand their levels of anxiety and distress as they complete exposure exercises in-session as well as homework assignments . SUDS range from 0 to 100 and function as an emotional thermometer , where 0 is perfectly relaxed , and 100 is the worst anxiety and distress ever experienced . b . It is useful to rate SUDs before beginning an exposure exercise . 4 . Conduct exposure with specified duration or trial number . a . It is important to agree upon the number of exposure trials as well as the duration of such beforehand . b . It may be best to think of duration in terms of the cumulative length of time of an exposure exercise as well as the amount of time it may take for SUDs to decrease to a sufficient level . 5 . Assess for SUDs/intensity of sensations . a . The general goal is for the SUDs to reduce across the repeated trials . b . The amount of reduction will depend on the patient ’ s first exposure exercise . 6 . Process patient ’ s feelings , thoughts , and associated SUDs over time 7 . Complete exposure process repeatedly , until SUDs reduce to the agreed level . You may find it difficult to develop an effective hierarchy and might struggle to identify an exposure exercise that leads to an appropriate level of intensity . As with other treatment types , trial and error ( with reflection ) and clinical consultation are critical to modifying and refining exposure-based treatments . Exposure may require modifications depending on the feared stimulus . For example , it is common for patients with blood-injury-injection phobias to experience a fainting response ( a physiological reaction that is associated with increased heart rate and blood pressure ) during exposure exercises . Prior to exposure exercises , counter measures or techniques such as applied tension strategies ( tensing the large muscle groups ) may be required to reduce heart rate and blood pressure spikes and , therefore , avoid a fainting response . 111 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 14 TERMINATING STEPS : ADVANCED PRACTICE CONSIDERATIONS Dealing with Setbacks Setbacks are also learning experiences if handled accordingly . You should prepare your patients for setbacks , as they are a normal and an expected part of growth and development . Building a foundation that includes setbacks helps to ensure open communication between the provider and patient about both positive and negative therapy experiences . If patients accept that setbacks will occur , you will be in a strong position to use any setbacks as growth and development for building skills and maintaining future changes . Involving Others Significant others can have a positive or negative impact on the maintenance of fear and anxiety . Although others may provide invaluable support for a specific treatment plan , they may also serve to unknowingly maintain anxiety by providing safety and support during critical exposure work . Providers who directly involve significant others in anxiety management treatments must ensure that communication is effective . Others involved in the care plan must have appropriate psychoeducation about anxiety and fear and ways anxiety is maintained . REFERENCES AND SUPPLEMENTAL READINGS Barlow , D. H. & Craske , M. C.

Problem-solving techniques generally involve a process by which individuals attempt to identify effective means of coping with problems of everyday living . This often involves a set of steps for analyzing a problem , identifying options for coping , evaluating the options , deciding upon a plan , and developing strategies for implementing the plan . Problem-solving strategies can be used with a wide range of problems , including depression , anxiety , anger and aggression , stress management , coping with medical illness , addiction , and relationship/family difficulties . Problem-solving techniques teach skills that aid the patient in feeling increased control over life issues that previously felt overwhelming or unmanageable . In this manner , problem solving can help with practical problem resolution as well as emotion-focused coping ( e. g. , increasing control , decreasing stress , and increasing hopefulness ) . When ? ( Indications/Contraindications ) Thoughts and beliefs are challenged when a thought or belief is not true or a situation is unchangeable . Alternatively , problem solving may be used when the root of an issue is a changeable situation ; and the thoughts associated with the noxious situation might be accurate . Problem solving can be especially effective when a specific problem is able to be addressed and operationalized . A specific operationalized problem is one that is easily explained , identified , and/or measured . Problem solving works best when a practical solution is available . For example , a patient complaining of social isolation likely has potential solutions to this difficulty ( e. g. , calling a friend , joining a group , engaging in a socially driven hobby ) . Examples of problems appropriate for problem solving include : 1 . How to communicate with a partner about a difficult issue 2 . How best to cope with the functional limitations of a medical condition 3 . How to reduce financial distress Note that you , as the provider , are not responsible for finding answers to these questions but rather should aid patients in finding their own answers . In this manner you are a facilitator who possesses problem-solving skills . 113 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 15 PROBLEM SOLVING MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALS : 1 . Patients with serious mental illness ( psychotic disorders , bipolar disorder ) 2 . Patients with severe depression , who might require more focused cognitive work or medications 3 . Patients who have difficulty thinking about long-term effects ( e. g. , persons with cognitive impairment ) 4 . Patients with problems that are largely emotional ; for example , a person who feels incompetent at work and often feels that others are overly critical may be reacting to emotions ( e. g. , depression ) . This problem may be better served using another skill ( e. g. , Unhelpful Thoughts modules ) . How ? ( Instructions/Handouts ) PROBLEM-SOLVING THERAPY ( PST ) In problem-solving therapy , it is important that you first educate the patient about the problem-solving strategies that will be used during sessions . To enable patients to use the strategies after therapy ends , teach them to carefully examine a problem , create a list of solutions , and make decisions about which strategies are appropriate for a variety of problems . General guidelines for using problem-solving strategies are as follows : • Training should be tailored and specific to each patient . • Obtain a thorough assessment of the problem before proceeding with problem- solving therapy . • Encourage the patient to try as many solutions as possible . • Decide whether the patient requires more problem-solving work or more emotional work to experience growth through the therapeutic process . STRATEGIES FOR EFFECTIVE PROBLEM SOLVING The SOLVED technique helps guide you through the steps to most effectively identify and solve problems in your life . S ( Selecting a Problem ) . . . the patient would like to solve . Ask the patient to think about situations when they feel distress or difficulty problem solving . If planning does not seem to be possible , suggest a different therapeutic technique ( e. g. , changing unhelpful thoughts ) . The decision to remain with problem solving or move to a different skill is largely dependent on you to direct . 114 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 15 O ( Opening Your Mind to All Solutions ) Here , it is important to be as broad as possible . You are encouraged to work with patients to “ brainstorm ” all possible solutions . Writing may be particularly helpful for some patients . Even ideas that seem ridiculous at first may generate realistic solutions . In-Session Example 15. 1 For example , Allison ’ s family would often drop by several times a week without calling beforehand and expect her to care for their children . She enjoyed this but felt tired many times and was beginning to get concerned about her ability to continue child sitting at such a frequent pace . Her first idea was to tell them she could no longer baby-sit . Although she did not like this idea , it led her to consider related ideas , such as telling them they had to call beforehand to make sure she felt up to the task . Highlight 15. 1 Tips for generating possible solutions : • Ask the patient to think about advice they would give someone else with this problem . • Ask the patient to examine the ways they have handled similar situations . • Instruct the patient to consult with a close friend or relative for additional solutions . L ( Listing the Potential Pros and Cons of Each Potential Solution ) Often , writing options , along with listing pros and cons , can be helpful in considering potential options . Writing allows additional thought , as well as a visual image of options . Recommend that patients consider solutions in a logical manner , thus reducing the time spent ruminating . It may also help to identify additional thoughts that might benefit from changes using the techniques , such as changing thoughts . In some cases , identification of pros/cons may require obtaining information from other people , such as lawyers or financial advisors . V ( Verifying the Best Solution ) Examine the pros and cons of the solutions listed . Patients may wish to “ rank order ” the solutions based on which solutions are most practical and/or desirable . E ( Enacting the Plan ) Identify the steps needed to carry out the solution selected . Patients may need to break actions down into steps small enough to facilitate achievement of goals . Once you and the patient finish formulating a specific plan , encourage the patient to carry it out . 115 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 15 D ( Deciding if the Plan Worked ) Follow-up with the patient to see how well the chosen solution worked . If the solution was effective , give positive reinforcement . If the solution was not effective , return to the first step in the SOLVED technique to specify a new problem or move to “ O ” or “ L ” to identify other goals or potential solutions for the same problem . The decision to move back and to which step is largely up to you , who might now have additional information about pros and cons and possible solutions . PROBLEM-SOLVING EXAMPLES To facilitate patient learning , you might wish to provide examples of the SOLVED program at work . The following section provides several examples of the SOLVED technique .

Relaxation techniques consist of a collection of psychotherapeutic techniques designed to reduce tension , stress , worry , and/or anxiety . Relaxation techniques vary in their focus ( e. g. , physical sensations or changes in cognition/thoughts ) and can be selected based on presenting difficulties , as well as patient preferences . Some patients respond to physical procedures ( e. g. , muscle relaxation and/or deep breathing ) , while others respond favorably to guided imagery . Relaxation techniques are important for brief therapy for several reasons . First , they focus on skills that alleviate stress , anxiety , worry , and tension that are often debilitating and interfere with patient functioning . Second , stress , anxiety , worry , and tension are often very uncomfortable for patients ; and providing help to alleviate distress can go a long way towards increasing positive treatment expectations and rapport . Relaxation techniques are easily conveyed as a method of increasing control and often do not include a direct discussion of mental health difficulties , which can be important for some patients who are concerned about mental health stigma . Finally , relaxation techniques are generally easy to teach and learn . For these reasons , it is often advantageous to teach these techniques early in treatment to give patients an easy-to- learn , yet highly effective , skill set . When ? ( Indications/Contraindications ) As indicated , relaxation techniques are quite effective early in treatment to reduce tension and increase early treatment successes . They generate increased self-efficacy , perceived control over stress , and improved coping . Examples of applications might include daily relaxation exercises to reduce an overall sense of tension or stress not affiliated with any specific situation ( e. g. , general worry or apprehension ) or the use of relaxation techniques to manage work-related stress in preparation for an upcoming social or family event . Relaxation procedures can also be appropriate for persons with depressive symptoms to increase their perceptions of control . However , it might not be appropriate for depressive symptoms occurring outside comorbid anxiety/worry . For example , teaching a severely depressed person , who is experiencing fatigue and lack of motivation , to relax would not be useful unless the patient has a specific need for relaxation . Additionally , relaxation techniques might not be appropriate for patients with anxiety and panic symptoms as they may use them as avoidance behaviors . Use of relaxation when faced with feared stimuli can reinforce anxiety and further exacerbate fear . 120 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 16 Relaxation techniques are appropriate for persons with chronic pain , migraines , and insomnia , as well as in smoking cessation treatment and weight management programs . These techniques can aid in symptom reduction and underlying issues that make it difficult for patients to cope with physical ailments . However , it is important to consider how various relaxation techniques are impacted by any physical limitations . How ? ( Instructions/Handouts ) Regardless of the actual relaxation technique , it is imperative that the physical environment be attended to so as to maximize results . Before beginning relaxation techniques , it is suggested that you create a safe , quiet , and comfortable environment . You are encouraged to work with patients to create such an environment . Patients may be comfortable with certain recommendations ( e. g. , unfolding arms ) but may be uncertain or uncomfortable with others ( e. g. , closing their eyes ) . The following list of options can be used to create an effective atmosphere for relaxation-based interventions . Setting up the room : • Comfortable chair ( a high-backed chair to support the patient ’ s neck , if possible ) • Safe and relaxing room ( e. g. , temperature , noise , and lighting ) Highlight 16. 1 Other tips to increase stress-management effectiveness include : • Having the patient loosen tight clothing ( collars , belts , shoes , etc . ) or remove glasses • Having the patient sit in a comfortable fashion ( e. g. , uncrossing arms and legs , placing feet flat on the floor ) • Dimming the lights or removing bright sunshine from the room • Having patients close their eyes • Asking patients whether they need a bathroom break before starting • Asking patients to clear their mind and focus on your voice and instructions The following sections of this module addresses three specific techniques : progressive muscle relaxation , deep breathing , and imagery . You largely determine selection of a specific technique , but you should select it with the patient 's expressed interests and learning preferences/abilities in mind . For example , patients who are largely somatically focused may prefer muscle relaxation or deep breathing . Other patients , especially those who appreciate the association between thoughts and mood , might be best served using guided imagery procedures . However , the ultimate decision of which procedure to use may relate to exposure to all three techniques and a trial-and-error approach . 121 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 16 PROGRESSIVE MUSCLE RELAXATION ( PMR ) PMR consists of learning how to tense and then relax various groups of muscles all through the body in a sequential fashion , while paying close attention to the feelings associated with both tension and relaxation . Although muscle relaxation has been around for many years , it has become more popular recently for dealing with different anxiety and panic disorders . With this procedure , the patient learns how to relax and how to recognize and pinpoint tension and relaxation in the body to identify tension and reduce its influence before each reaches high levels/impairment . In teaching patients muscle relaxation , you should first explain the reason for using muscle relaxation and how it will benefit the patient ( rationale ) . You should also give a full explanation and demonstration of how it is done . Step # 1 : PMR Increases Control . Introduce PMR principles and procedures . PMR begins by letting patients know that they can create sensations of relaxation and that this process of “ inducing ” relaxation begins by being able to identify and discriminate between sensations of tension and relaxation . Step # 2 : Note the Incongruence of Tension and Relaxation . Inform the patient that sensations of tension and relaxation can not occur at the same time . No muscles in the body can be tensed and relaxed at the same time . This principle is critical , and you should ensure that patients fully understand how this applies to their current difficulties . Step # 3 : Identify States of Tension . Explain to the patient that tension often builds gradually without conscious awareness . Learning to detect the initial signs of an increase is an important step towards avoiding a full-blown occurrence of tension . Inform patients that , no matter the level of intensity , they can stop and reverse the tension using knowledge of PMR – in essence , it is never too late to reduce tension . Over time patients become increasingly skilled at identifying stress earlier and earlier ( e. g. , their awareness increases ) . Step # 4 : Tense Muscle Groups . Highlight 16. 2 A brief word of caution : If at any point during the technique a patient experiences pain , alter or completely discontinue the technique . If the patient experiences chronic pain in any part of the body , it is best to avoid the tensing component when the patient gets to those muscle groups . PMR asks the patient to tense and release different muscle groups in sequence , moving from the arms to the face , neck , chest and shoulders , torso , and legs . For each specific muscle group , it ’ s important to try to tense only that muscle group during the tensing part of the exercise . Throughout the procedure , it is important to concentrate on the sensations produced by the different exercises . Asking the patient to describe bodily sensations is 122 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 16 very important for the learning process . Statements or phrases from you might include : “ What are you noticing about your body right now ? ” These questions help the patient to focus on the way the body “ feels ” when tense and relaxed . TENSING INSTRUCTIONS Model each tension procedure . Ask the patient to practice , and provide feedback . Check to be sure that the patient can identify tension in each group before moving on to the next . a . Dominant arm . Make a fist and tense biceps ; pull wrist upward , while pushing elbow down against the arm of chair or bed . b. Nondominant arm . Same as above . c. Forehead , lower cheeks and jaw . Lift eyebrows as high as possible , bite teeth together , and pull corners of mouth tightly . d. Neck and throat . Pull chin down toward chest ; at the same time , try to prevent it from actually touching the chest . Counterpose muscles in front part of neck against those in the back part of neck . e. Shoulders , chest , and upper back/abdomen . Take a deep breath and hold it . At the same time , pull the shoulder blades back and together , trying to make them touch . Try to keep your arms as relaxed as possible while tensing this muscle group . At the same time make the stomach hard by pressing it out , as if someone were going to hit you in the stomach . f. Dominant leg . Lift foot off the floor and push down on the chair with thigh . g. Nondominant leg . Same as above . Step # 5 : Debrief After the Exercise. After relaxation training , question the patient about his or her reaction to the muscle- relaxation exercise . It is also important to make any adjustments needed to the training . Monitor any pain the patient experienced to adapt and improve the technique for the individual patient ’ s needs . Step # 6 : Continue to Practice Outside Session . It will be important for the patients to practice PMR at least once a day over the first week or two to build skills and confidence . As they become increasingly skilled at PMR , they might find it possible to relax without having to actively tense the muscles . The patients should use regularly scheduled homework to practice in a nondistracting environment . When they have learned to relax in a calm environment , it should be easier to relax in more distracting situations , whenever they notice tension developing . 123 DEEP-BREATHING TECHNIQUE Another physiological-based relaxation technique is deep breathing . Deep breathing focuses on reducing rapid and shallow ( ineffective ) breathing that often occurs during periods of stress , worry , or anxiety . Rapid and shallow breaths can lead the patient to have decreased oxygen in the system , which can cause hyperventilation , dizziness , lightheadedness , or decreased ability to concentrate . Alternatively , taking a deep , full breath can produce a feeling of calmness or slowing by increasing oxygen-rich blood flow . It can also strengthen muscles in the chest and stomach , which can make it easier to breathe on a daily basis . STEPS TO DEEP BREATHING : Step # 1 : Introduce the patient to Deep Breathing . Indicate why Deep Breathing was chosen , and provide an overview of the procedures and potential benefits . Step # 2 : Ask the patient to put one hand on the abdomen , with the little finger about one inch above the navel , and to place one hand on the chest . Step # 3 : Ask the patient to pay attention to their breathing ( pause for several seconds to allow the patient the opportunity to assess breathing ) and then to tell you which hand is doing more of the moving . Ideally , the hand on the abdomen should be moving ; while the hand over the chest remains still . This ensures that the breaths are deep . Step # 4 : Work with the patient to take deeper breaths by getting the hand over the stomach to move while having little movement of the hand over the chest . Inform the patient , ” Your hand on your diaphragm should move out as you inhale and in as you exhale. ” Highlight 16. 3 NOTE : Patients with a lung or heart condition might have difficulty with deep breathing . If patients report difficulty , slow the process down and help them to maximize the exercise comfortably . Step # 5 : To pace the patient , you might suggest saying the words in and out slowly , while taking breaths . Inhalations and exhalations should build to approximately three seconds in duration . Step # 6 : Ask patients if they notice any changes in breathing and feelings of relaxation . Ask for general feedback about the technique . Step # 7 : Repeat the breathing exercise three or more times until the patient reports skill understanding and benefit . Step # 8 : Ask the patient to identify situations when deep breathing might be appropriate . ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 16 124 Step # 9 : Continue practice outside of session . Work with the patient to set a homework assignment that encourages application of Deep Breathing to situations when the patient feels stress . Highlight 16. 4 Other tips for Deep Breathing : 1 . Inhale through nose and out of mouth . 2 . Ask patient to purse lips ( as if blowing on hot soup ) while exhaling . 3 . Do not pause between inhales and exhales . 4 . Ask patient to close eyes during the exercise . 5 . Patient may want to use mantra such as “ relax ” during each exhale . 6 . Pair up deep breathing with imagery once the patient has begun to master breathing skills . 7 . Point out that deep breathing is a portable skill that can be used in a variety of situations and relatively without notice of others ( PMR is less portable ) . IMAGERY Imagery is a cognitive relaxation technique that can be used to ease stress and promote an overall sense of well-being . Imagery focuses on increasing cognitive , emotional , and physical control by changing the focus of an individual ’ s thoughts . We all have daydreamed about pleasant things that have distracted us and made us feel better . Imagery uses much the same process but encourages positive adaptive “ dreaming ” that distracts and relaxes the individual . Imagery is highly effective for depression and anxiety , as well as specific situations that require clarity , focus , distraction , or feelings of mastery . The following are examples : Table 16. 1 Imagery Examples ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 16 TOPIC FOCUSED TOPIC IMAGE OUTCOME Depression Negative Self-worth Images of success or past situations of success , images of a pleasant past experience Increased self-confidence , reduced negative thoughts ’ distraction from negative mood Anxiety/Worry Public Speaking Image of speech that goes well , image of something funny Reduced negative focus , distraction , increased positive expectations Medical Anxiety Fear of Procedure ( e. g. , needles ) Relaxation , peacefulness , pain-free environment Less tension , reduced anxiety , toleration of procedure with less distress Sports Performance Focused efforts during golf game Envisioning the desired shot , positive words of advice Increased focus , increased self-confidence , positive thinking 125 How Guided Imagery Works Research has shown that the mind can affect how the body functions . It seems the body may not know the difference between an actual event and a thought . Guided imagery uses the power of the brain—images and the perception that you are either somewhere else or in a different state of mind—to increase pleasant experiences and performance to promote wellness and health . On the flip side , imagery helps to reduce stress tension and anxiety by changing thoughts and emotions or through distraction . Imagery is commonly referred to as guided imagery . Guided imagery refers to a process whereby you facilitate or guide the initial images the patient uses . The following section describes how you can guide the patient into the effective use of imagery for relaxation or performance improvement . Step # 1 : Introduce Imagery . Introduce imagery to the patient , pointing out the power of the brain or thoughts and how images , when accessed correctly , can change physical and emotional states . Step # 2 : Identify the Desired Outcomes , Such as Decreased Anxiety , Increased Focus , Distraction . Step # 3 : Develop an Image or Scene . Work with the patient on the third step to identify a situation , either in the past or a desirable place to be , that both you and the patient feel might benefit or produce the desired outcome . Sample imagery scripts are provided below and can be used if the patient has difficulty creating a personal situation . Selection of a powerful image is critical to the success of this technique . Selection of an image that the patient is able to fully embrace increases the odds of treatment success . Selection of a “ weak ” image ( e. g. , not viewed as important by the patient or unable to be fully visualized ) will likely lead to treatment failure . Step # 4 : Increase Vividness of the Image . To ensure that patients find a “ strong ” image , ask them to explore as many senses as possible to increase vividness of the image . For example , when imagining a glass of lemonade , imagine holding a glass that feels icy and cold ; visualize the color of the lemonade ; think of the fresh citrus smell ; and , finally , think of how the lemonade tastes . This is an example of imagery that uses multiple senses and increases vividness of the image . Increasing vividness is largely a matter of increasing the details the patient experiences . The more details described by the patient , the more powerful the technique . Step # 5 : Ask Patients if They Notice Any Changes After the Imagery Exercise . Ask for general feedback about the technique . Step # 6 : Repeat the Imagery Exercise Until the Patient Reports Skill Understanding and Benefit . ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 16 126 Step # 7 : Ask the Patient to Identify Situations When Imagery Might Be Appropriate . Expand upon the patient ’ s responses by adding other situations ( e. g. , how the technique can be used ) . Step # 8 : Continue Practice Outside Session . Work with the patient to set a homework assignment that encourages application of imagery to situations when the patient feels stress or feels that imagery might be beneficial . Highlight 16. 5 Other tips for imagery : 1 . Pair up imagery with deep-breathing exercises . 2 . Ask patient to close eyes during the exercise to increase vividness . 3 . Interject during the imagery experience aspects that you feel might benefit the patient . For example , a patient might use a beach image ; and you might ask how the sun feels on the skin , whether there are sounds , or what else is visible . 4 . Help the patient focus on aspects of the image that will guide them towards the goal . Help the patient to avoid too many unnecessary details that might distract from the goal . 5 . Point out that imagery is a portable skill that the patient can use in a variety of situations and completely without notice of others ( PMR is less portable ) . 6 . Avoid imagery with psychotic patients , who might confuse reality with images .

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 16 129 SPECIAL POPULATIONS CHAPTER | MODULE 17 Module 17 : Adaptation of b CBT for Special Clinical Populations OBJECTIVES • To recognize cultural and diagnostic components associated with clinical populations • To understand clinical considerations of specific clinical populations • To learn how to adapt brief CBT for specific clinical populations Introduction Introduction Special clinical populations present unique life experiences , therefore requiring a therapeutic approach that understands this uniqueness and appreciates the context of the individual when engaging in clinical interventions . We describe four general clinical populations that may require more critical analysis of how best to apply brief CBT techniques . Military Populations Military personnel face unique and often intense physical and psychological challenges when serving their country . A 2014 research article ( JAMA Psychiatry , 2014 ) found that one in four active duty military personnel had signs indicating the presence of a mental health condition . Common mental health disorders in military populations include depression , anxiety , substance abuse and posttraumatic stress disorder . Individuals may also face physical health changes due to injury . Common somatic and emotional health symptoms may include chronic pain , insomnia , and anger management difficulties . Notably , somatic symptoms may be related to emotional health difficulties ; and substance abuse issues may “ mask ” other mental health difficulties – especially those related to trauma . Finally , military personnel are at increased risk of suicide regardless of service era – but personnel from the recent Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts have been found to have high rates ( 20 % or greater ) of traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , which further elevates mental health difficulties and suicide risk . While on active duty , military personnel often face challenges that range from mild but chronic stressors ( e. g . requiring to be “ on guard ” while in combat environments regardless of actually being in conflict ) to acute and severe stressors ( e. g . physical injury or death or injury to a colleague or civilians ) . Although combat stressors are commonly associated with increased stress and mental health demands , other aspects of military life create challenges that may include post deployment reintegration into civilian life , social isolation , or possibly even severe non combat trauma such as military sexual assault . Regardless of the specific stressors or “ triggering events , ” it is important to recognize that not all military personnel require mental health services . However , many military personnel will face mental health challenges that do not reflect weakness on the part of the service member . These challenges must also be understood within the context of the service 130 member ’ s home and/or social environment to fully appreciate the impact and potential sources of support to address any mental health conditions . THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS AND ADAPTATIONS Providers are encouraged to explore the meaning of military service and the possible relationship between military service , military-related stressors , and resiliency factors . Military culture may play a significant role in the way in which service members approach mental health treatment . For example , military culture places a premium on strength and resilience , which may be at odds with help-seeking behaviors . In some instances , emphasis on strength and resiliency may lead to social isolation and/or limited sharing of emotional or psychological struggles . Additionally , service members may face ramifications for seeking help that impact their careers such as pilots no longer being allowed to fly or security forces no longer being allowed to carry weapons . Stigma around seeking help can carry over for Veterans if they continue to work in national security positions as civilians or contractors . For all service members and Veterans , providers must attend to suicidal ideation and/or plans and should be prepared to actively manage these concerns using a comprehensive suicide assessment and safety plan ( where needed ) . Importantly , this population tends to have greater access to firearms and lethal means than civilians . Providers should know their state laws for how to ensure lethal means safety for at risk groups . POTENTIAL BRIEF CBT ADAPTATIONS Providers may wish to consider the following adaptations to their traditional CBT approaches when working with military personnel and Veterans : 1 . Integration of prior military experiences . For military personnel who strongly relate to their current and prior military service , providers are encouraged to explore the patient ’ s military experiences for examples of challenges , coping , and successes . These examples may provide valuable information for treatment planning while also helping in understanding the patient ’ s military context and developing rapport . 2 . Peer support and social connection . Given the elevated potential for suicide , social isolation can be a critical contributing factor to the maintenance of emotional health difficulties . Many military personnel place a high value on service , family , and country . Although they do not want to be a burden on others , they are often willing to consider the value of others in their lives and the need to connect ( re-connect ) through the encouragement of a planned therapeutic plan . 3 . Romantic relationship status . Among military members , relationship problems are among the most common antecedents for suicide . Routinely monitoring relationship status is important and can signal any acute mental health status changes that may arise . 4 . Attending to physical health and functional changes . Many military personnel will face physical and/or functional health changes that require lifestyle modifications . Many of these challenges push patients away from activities that previously brought them pleasure . Providers are encouraged to consider these prior activities ( and the losses ) the military member is now facing , and then identify new activities , SPECIAL POPULATIONS CHAPTER | MODULE 17 131 especially social activities , where possible , that remain available to the patient . For example , a patient who had been runner who is now no longer physically able to run may identify meaning in being outdoors , being with others during early morning runs , or feeling a sense of accomplishment . Although running is no longer possible , activities that are outdoors , involve others , and provide as sense of accomplishment are often possible . RESOURCES www. mentalhealth. va. gov Veterans Crisis Line 800 273 8255 Option # 1 Older Adult Populations Older adults , particularly those ages 65 and up , represent a unique population that often face life circumstances and challenges related to work and retirement and changes in family dynamics or living arrangements , as well as increased attention to physical health conditions including changes in cognition and memory . These changes may include physical or functional changes but many individuals will face these challenges especially with advanced age . Older adults are at increased risk for social isolation and suicide , and these issues are further complicated when combined with a physical illness or changes in cognitive functioning ( e. g . dementia ) . POTENTIAL ADAPTATIONS TO CBT FOR OLDER ADULT POPULATIONS 1 . Speed and pace of therapy . Older adults , especially those new to psychotherapy , are likely to benefit from a pace of therapy that meets their emotional and cognitive needs . As a population , older adults vary greatly in their functional and cognitive abilities , and you must be prepared to adapt your approaches accordingly . Some older adults will require no modifications while others will need a pace and speed of therapy that are slower and use simplified language and intervention approaches . For example , some older adults may better identify and grasp the concepts of behavioral activation ( e. g . pleasant events ) versus more psychologically complex concepts , such as exposure or cognitive/thinking patterns that maintain behaviors . 2 . Inclusion of caregivers and significant others . Although not appropriate for all older adults , the inclusion of caregivers may offer unique opportunities for providers to engage family or friends for at-risk older adults – especially those facing cognitive impairment , increased suicide risk , or social isolation . Caregivers may serve as passive supporters or as active members that facilitate treatment planning and/or between-session skill assignments . 3 . Auditory or visual impairments . Providers are encouraged to assess for any auditory or visual needs when working with older adults . Specific needs may require alteration in telephone or other virtual platform delivery and may be important for written between-session assignments. SPECIAL POPULATIONS CHAPTER | MODULE 17 1324 . Cognitive impairments . Patients with cognitive impairments may benefit from simplified treatment plans and the incorporation of caregivers and/or significant others to facilitate treatment plans . See below for a specific section on cognitive impairment . Medically Ill Populations Patients that present with chronic medical diagnoses or with terminal sickness include a wide array of medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease , diabetes , cancers , HIV/AIDS , and autoimmune disorders ( i. e. , rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , and multiple sclerosis ) . These vulnerable health populations often have comorbid mental health diagnoses or related symptomology . Individuals with chronic or long-term health conditions are two to three times more likely to present with mental health disorders , including anxiety and depression ( Hudson & Moss-Morris , 2019 ) . Due to the likelihood of acute changes in health care and status , use of brief CBT techniques is optimal to deal with specific and short-term distress concerns . POTENTIAL BRIEF CBT ADAPTATIONS Providers may consider the following when working with medically ill patients : 1 . Prevalence of health-related distress . Experiencing acute distress in response to receiving medical diagnoses or sudden changes to health status are expected within this population . Providers should keep in mind that health-related distress may be the focus of much of the therapy . Patients ’ anxiety or depression may be symptoms of coping with their changing health status . Providers may consider introducing behavioral activation activities that require low levels of physical involvement and cognitive restructuring around any thoughts related to negative views of the self or world in this new stage of life . 2 . Need for flexible treatment delivery . The setting of the therapy will be dependent on patients ’ current health status . Providers may have to shift from their traditional office setting to treat patients that are in the hospital or can not leave their home . Providers are encouraged to pay special attention to the patient ’ s medical appointment schedule and allow for flexibility in the timing and amount of allowed session cancellations . Additionally , use of telehealth services becomes more important with this population and can increase the level of access to mental health treatment . 3 . Between-session workload . Homework and in-between session practice are important to treatment success with CBT . However , providers should consider each patient ’ s health status and use judgment in the amount and appropriateness of in-between session expectations . Talk with your patients about how feasible and/or likely it is they will be able to complete activities for that week . 4 . Caregiver presence . Patients with severe health complications or dealing with functional impairments may require assistance from caregivers . Be mindful that caregivers may become integral in facilitating therapy for patients . Also , be aware that caregiver concerns and interpersonal issues between the patient and caregivers may be a central focus in therapy . SPECIAL POPULATIONS CHAPTER | MODULE 17 133 Populations with Cognitive Impairment More than 16 million people in the United States are living with cognitive impairment such as mild cognitive impairment disorder , traumatic brain injury , Alzheimer ’ s disease and other dementias , and developmental disorders ( e. g. , autism spectrum disorder ) ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2019 ) . Cognitive impairment can affect individuals of all age groups and impact an individual ’ s memory , concentration , and decision-making . These difficulties can cause issues with processing information , ability to communicate effectively , and everyday functioning . Patients will have related mental health concerns stemming from their clinical diagnoses or related to distress of coping with functional changes . POTENTIAL BRIEF CBT ADAPTATIONS Providers may consider the following when working with medically ill patients : 1 . Timing and pace of therapy . Patients in this population may struggle with maintaining attention , processing information , or communicating their treatment needs . Consider a slower pace when communicating information and routinely checking in with patients to ensure they are keeping up with you during the session . Also , allow more time during the assessment phase to gain understanding of the patients ’ needs and to develop a treatment plan tailored to their clinical presentation . 2 . Patient support . Providers should consider integrating caregivers , family members , or other support for these patients . These individuals will be liaisons between sessions , communicate information that the patient might have missed during the session , and help maintain treatment progress throughout the course of treatment . 3 . Technique appropriateness . Consider the appropriateness of cognitive restructuring techniques for this population . These techniques are based on abstract themes and can be difficult for patients to understand , especially if cognitive impairment exists . Use aspects of patients ’ interests when describing examples of CBT and cognitive restructuring to aid in their understanding . If patients lack the capability to grasp this technique , focus your energy on behavioral activation or problem-solving techniques that are safe for patients to integrate into their schedule . SPECIAL POPULATIONS CHAPTER | MODULE 17 134 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 18 Module 18 : Ending Treatment and Maintaining Changes OBJECTIVES • To understand the process for preparing the patient for ending treatment • To learn techniques for preventing relapse What Is Ending Treatment , and Why Is It Important To Plan for It ? End-of-treatment planning is the collaborative process of preparing the patients and assessing their readiness for ending treatment and moving beyond reliance on the provider to apply skills . Planning allows the patient to prepare for the end of treatment , to review skills learned in treatment , and to vocalize and problem-solve concerns about functioning outside treatment . All these factors reduce anxiety and allay fears a patient might have about ending a therapeutic relationship . When ? ( Indications/Contraindications ) End-of-treatment planning begins at the first session when you give the patient some indication of the frequency and duration of treatment . End-of-treatment planning is an ongoing process , culminating in the final sessions with a review of treatment and introduction of relapse-prevention skills . Patients with personality disorders or disorders of attachment may be particularly sensitive to feeling abandoned or upset as a result of ending the therapeutic relationship . For these patients , it is important to discuss treatment termination in an empowering and thoughtful way—recognizing and normalizing their fears , assuring them safeguards are in place ( e. g. , emergency resources , booster sessions ) , and encouraging them via reminders that the purpose of CBT is self-management of symptoms . Measurement-based care used throughout treatment will inform an appropriate time for end-of-treatment . You can decide if additional sessions , a complete end-of-treatment , or booster sessions are needed depending on the type or intensity of symptoms the patient is still reporting . However , measurement-based care should be used in addition to ongoing conversations with the patient , your clinical judgment , and clinical requirements and procedures of the clinical facility . How ? ( Instructions/Handouts ) REVIEWING WHAT WAS LEARNED The last session of brief CBT should be spent reviewing and recording the different cognitive and behavioral skills the patient has learned . Use Socratic questioning to elicit this list ( “ What have you learned as a result of our time together ? Is there anything that was particularly meaningful to you about your time in therapy ? ” ) , as patients may generate skills or benefits of therapy not known to you . Patients should have a list of 135 these skills they can take with them . They should also be encouraged to keep the other handouts ( e. g. , Thought Records ) completed during treatment as a reminder of their skills . RELAPSE PREVENTION Many patients are concerned that they will not be able to manage future psychological problems or psychosocial stressors without the aid of therapy . In planning for the end of treatment , you and patients anticipate potential stressors and symptoms and plan : 1 ) What tools the patients have learned in therapy that they could use for particular stressors/symptoms , and 2 ) when patients might need to contact a mental health professional for additional assistance ( e. g. , suicidal ideation ) . Preparing for inevitable difficulties is empowering and encouraging for patients . A functional assessment may be used to identify future problematic situations ( see Module 4 ) . In-Session Example 18. 1 Relapse-Prevention Questions 1 . When I feel ( symptom ) , I will ( tool learned in therapy ) . 2 . If ( stressor ) , I will ( tool learned in therapy ) . Example : When I feel sad for two days , I will go for a walk and call a friend to have lunch . When I feel depressed for a month , I will schedule an appointment with my primary care physician/mental health provider . If my boyfriend breaks up with me , I will do a Thought Record to evaluate any unhelpful thoughts . TROUBLESHOOTING END OF TREATMENT Give Yourself Adequate Time to End Treatment . Plan on an entire session devoted to ending treatment , wrapping up , and maintaining changes . It is highly recommended that you not introduce new concepts during the final session , as new issues may arise ; and ending treatment during the session may become impossible . GIVE THE PATIENT CREDIT Patients often attribute positive change to external entities and negative change to themselves . Therefore , at the end of treatment , discuss the patient ’ s progress ( using objective data , such as symptom-rating scales , when available ) , praise the patient , and emphasize the patient ’ s role in positive changes . ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS | MODULE 18 136 RESPOND TO CONCERNS Checking in with the patient regularly about questions or concerns about ending treatment helps maintain the therapeutic relationship and offset negative emotions about treatment that could result in negative outcomes , such as feeling abandoned . If patients seem particularly concerned about ending treatment , they could use a Thought Record to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts associated with leaving therapy . PLAN SELF-MANAGEMENT TIME Patients may be interested in planning self-management time when preparing for the end of treatment . Self-management times are a few minutes each week that patients set aside , once therapy is complete , to check mood and use of skills and problem solve situations or feelings that may be negatively affecting their mood . These times last approximately 10-15 minutes and follow a structure similar to therapy . Self-management time is beneficial because it is free , can be conducted at and when and where it is convenient for the patient , and helps prevent relapse . A self-management worksheet ( found at the end of this module ) may be used during these times . BOOSTER SESSIONS Booster sessions can be scheduled approximately one month following the end of treatment and then as needed thereafter . During a booster session , you : • Check in with the patient about self-management of symptoms and stressors . • Refresh skills learned in therapy . • Discuss questions or concerns the patient might have about the transition . • Review treatment goals and maintenance of treatment gains .

{"text_id": 4, "title": "Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Basics and Beyond", "text": " 1 Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPYA revolution in the fi eld of mental health was initiated in the early 1960 s by Aaron T. Beck, MD, then an assistant professor in psy-chiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Beck was a fully trained and practicing psychoanalyst. A scientist at heart, he believed that in order for psychoanalysis to be accepted by the medical community, its theories needed to be demonstrated as empirically valid. In the late 1950 s and early 1960 s, he embarked on a series of experiments that he fully expected would produce such validation. Instead, the oppo-site occurred. The results of Dr. Beck’s experiments led him to search for other explanations for depression. He identifi ed distorted, nega-tive cognition (primarily thoughts and beliefs) as a primary feature of depression and developed a short-term treatment, one of whose pri-mary targets was the reality testing of patients’ depressed thinking. In this chapter, you will fi nd the answers to the following ques-tions:What is cognitive behavior therapy? • How was it developed? • What does research tell us about its effectiveness? • What are its basic principles? • How can you become an effective cognitive behavior therapist? • 2 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND WHAT I S COGNITIVE B EHAVIOR T HERAPY ? Aaron Beck developed a form of psychotherapy in the early 1960 s that he originally termed “cognitive therapy. ” “Cognitive therapy” is now used synonymously with “cognitive behavior therapy” by much of our field and it is this latter term that will be used throughout this volume. Beck devised a structured, short-term, present-oriented psychotherapy for depression, directed toward solving current problems and modify -ing dysfunctional (inaccurate and/or unhelpful) thinking and behavior (Beck, 1964). Since that time, he and others have successfully adapted this therapy to a surprisingly diverse set of populations with a wide range of disorders and problems. These adaptations have changed the focus, techniques, and length of treatment, but the theoretical assumptions themselves have remained constant. In all forms of cognitive behavior therapy that are derived from Beck’s model, treatment is based on a cognitive formulation, the beliefs and behavioral strategies that charac -terize a specific disorder (Alford & Beck, 1997). Treatment is also based on a conceptualization, or understanding, of individual patients (their specific beliefs and patterns of behavior). The therapist seeks in a variety of ways to produce cognitive change—modification in the patient’s thinking and belief system—to bring about enduring emotional and behavioral change. Beck drew on a number of different sources when he developed this form of psychotherapy, including early philosophers, such as Epicetus, and theorists, such as Karen Horney, Alfred Adler, George Kelly, Albert Ellis, Richard Lazarus, and Albert Bandura. Beck’s work, in turn, has been expanded by current researchers and theorists, too numerous to recount here, in the United States and abroad. There are a number of forms of cognitive behavior therapy that share characteristics of Beck’s therapy, but whose conceptualizations and emphases in treatment vary to some degree. These include rational emotional behavior therapy (Ellis, 1962), dialectical behavior therapy (Linehan, 1993), problem-solving therapy (D’Zurilla & Nezu, 2006), acceptance and commitment therapy (Hayes, Follette, & Linehan, 2004), exposure therapy (Foa & Rothbaum, 1998), cognitive process -ing therapy (Resick & Schnicke, 1993), cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (Mc Cullough, 1999), behavioral activation (Lewinsohn, Sullivan, & Grosscup, 1980; Martell, Addis, & Jacobson, 2001), cognitive behavior modification (Meichenbaum, 1977), and oth -ers. Beck’s cognitive behavior therapy often incorporates techniques from all these therapies, and other psychotherapies, within a cognitive framework. Historical overviews of the field provide a rich description of how the different streams of cognitive behavior therapy originated Introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy 3 and grew (Arnkoff & Glass, 1992; A. Beck, 2005; Clark, Beck, & Alford, 1999; Dobson & Dozois, 2009; Hollon & Beck, 1993). Cognitive behavior therapy has been adapted for patients with diverse levels of education and income as well as a variety of cultures and ages, from young children to older adults. It is now used in pri -mary care and other medical offices, schools, vocational programs, and prisons, among other settings. It is used in group, couple, and family formats. While the treatment described in this book focuses on individ -ual 45-minute sessions, treatment can be briefer. Some patients, such as those who suffer from schizophrenia, often cannot tolerate a full session, and some practitioners can use cognitive therapy techniques, without conducting a full therapy session, within a medical or rehabili -tation appointment or medication check. WHAT I S THE T HEORY U NDER l YING COGNITIVE B EHAVIOR T HERAPY ? In a nutshell, the cognitive model proposes that dysfunctional thinking (which influences the patient’s mood and behavior) is common to all psychological disturbances. When people learn to evaluate their think -ing in a more realistic and adaptive way, they experience improvement in their emotional state and in their behavior. For example, if you were quite depressed and bounced some checks, you might have an auto-matic thought , an idea that just seemed to pop up in your mind: “I can’t do anything right. ” This thought might then lead to a particular reac -tion: you might feel sad (emotion) and retreat to bed (behavior). If you then examined the validity of this idea, you might conclude that you had overgeneralized and that, in fact, you actually do many things well. Looking at your experience from this new perspective would probably make you feel better and lead to more functional behavior. For lasting improvement in patients’ mood and behavior, cogni -tive therapists work at a deeper level of cognition: patients’ basic beliefs about themselves, their world, and other people. Modification of their underlying dysfunctional beliefs produces more enduring change. For example, if you continually underestimate your abilities, you might have an underlying belief of incompetence. Modifying this general belief (i. e. , seeing yourself in a more realistic light as having both strengths and weaknesses) can alter your perception of specific situations that you encounter daily. You will no longer have as many thoughts with the theme, “I can’t do anything right. ” Instead, in specific situations where you make mistakes, you will probably think, “I’m not good at this [spe -cific task]. ” 4 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND WHAT D OES THE R ESEARCH S AY? Cognitive behavior therapy has been extensively tested since the first outcome study was published in 1977 (Rush, Beck, Kovacs, & Hollon, 1977). At this point, more than 500 outcome studies have demonstrated the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy for a wide range of psychiatric disorders, psychological problems, and medical problems with psycho -logical components (see, e. g. , Butler, Chapman, Forman, & Beck, 2005; Chambless & Ollendick, 2001). Table 1. 1 lists many of the disorders and problems that have been successfully treated with cognitive behavior therapy. A more complete list may be found at www. beckinstitute. org . Studies have been conducted that demonstrate the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy in community settings (see, e. g. , Shadish, Matt, Navarro & Philips, 2000; Simons et al. , 2010; Stirman, Buchhofer, Mc Laulin, Evans, & Beck, 2009). Other studies have found computer-assisted cognitive behavior therapy to be effective (see, e. g. , Khanna & Kendall, 2010; Wright et al. , 2002). And several researchers have demonstrated that there are neurobiological changes associated with cognitive behavior therapy treatment for various disorders (see, e. g. , TABLE 1. 1. Partial List of Disorders Successfully Treated by Cognitive Behavior Therapy Psychiatric disorders Psychological problems Medical problems with psychological components Major depressive disorder Geriatric depression Generalized anxiety disorder Geriatric anxiety Panic disorder Agoraphobia Social phobia Obsessive–compulsive disorder Conduct disorder Substance abuse Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder Health anxiety Body dysmorphic disorder Eating disorders Personality disorders Sex offenders Habit disorders Bipolar disorder (with medication)Schizophrenia (with medication)Couple problems Family problems Pathological gambling Complicated grief Caregiver distress Anger and hostility Chronic back pain Sickle cell disease pain Migraine headaches Tinnitus Cancer pain Somatoform disorders Irritable bowel syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome Rheumatic disease pain Erectile dysfunction Insomnia Obesity Vulvodynia Hypertension Gulf War syndrome Introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy 5 Goldapple et al. , 2004). Hundreds of research studies have also vali -dated the cognitive model of depression and of anxiety. A comprehen -sive review of these studies can be found in Clark and colleagues (1999) and in Clark and Beck (2010). HOW W AS B ECk’S COGNITIVE B EHAVIOR THERAPY DEVEl OPED ? In the late 1950 s and early 1960 s, Dr. Beck decided to test the psycho -analytic concept that depression is the result of hostility turned inward toward the self. He investigated the dreams of depressed patients, which, he predicted, would manifest greater themes of hostility than the dreams of normal controls. To his surprise, he ultimately found that the dreams of depressed patients contained fewer themes of hostil -ity and far greater themes of defectiveness, deprivation, and loss. He recognized that these themes paralleled his patients’ thinking when they were awake. The results of other studies Beck conducted led him to believe that a related psychoanalytic idea—that depressed patients have a need to suffer—might be inaccurate (Beck, 1967). At that point, it was almost as if a stacked row of dominoes began to fall. If these psychoanalytic concepts were not valid, how else could depression be understood? As Dr. Beck listened to his patients on the couch, he realized that they occasionally reported two streams of thinking: a free-association stream and quick, evaluative thoughts about themselves. One woman, for example, detailed her sexual exploits. She then reported feeling anxious. Dr. Beck made an interpretation: “You thought I was criticiz -ing you. ” The patient disagreed: “No, I was afraid I was boring you. ” Upon questioning his other depressed patients, Dr. Beck recognized that all of them experienced “automatic” negative thoughts such as these, and that this second stream of thoughts was closely tied to their emotions. He began to help his patients identify, evaluate, and respond to their unrealistic and maladaptive thinking. When he did so, they rapidly improved. Dr. Beck then began to teach his psychiatric residents at the Uni -versity of Pennsylvania to use this form of treatment. They, too, found that their patients responded well. The chief resident, A. John Rush, MD, now a leading authority in the field of depression, discussed con -ducting an outcome trial with Dr. Beck. They agreed that such a study was necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of cognitive therapy to others. Their randomized controlled study of depressed patients, published in 1977, established that cognitive therapy was as effective as imipramine, a common antidepressant. This was an astounding study. It was one 6 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND of the first times that a talk therapy had been compared to a medica -tion. Beck, Rush, Shaw, and Emery (1979) published the first cognitive therapy treatment manual 2 years later. Important components of cognitive behavior therapy for depres -sion include a focus on helping patients solve problems; become behaviorally activated; and identify, evaluate, and respond to their depressed thinking, especially to negative thoughts about themselves, their worlds, and their future. In the late 1970 s Dr. Beck and his post -doctoral fellows at the University of Pennsylvania began to study anxi -ety, and found that a somewhat different focus was necessary. Patients with anxiety needed to better assess the risk of situations they feared, to consider their internal and external resources, and improve upon their resources. They also needed to decrease their avoidance and con -front situations they feared so they could test their negative predictions behaviorally. Since that time, the cognitive model of anxiety has been refined for each of the various anxiety disorders, cognitive psychology has verified these models, and outcome studies have demonstrated the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety disorders (Clark & Beck, 2010). Fast-forward several decades. Dr. Beck, his fellows, and other researchers worldwide continue to study, theorize, adapt, and test treat -ments for patients who suffer from an ever-growing list of problems. Cognitive therapy or cognitive behavior therapy is now taught in most graduate schools in the United States and in many other countries. WHAT A RE THE B ASIC P RINCIP l ES O f TREAT m ENT? Although therapy must be tailored to the individual, there are, nev -ertheless, certain principles that underlie cognitive behavior therapy for all patients. Throughout the book, I use a depressed patient, Sally, to illustrate these central tenets and to demonstrate how to use cog -nitive theory to understand patients’ difficulties and how to use this understanding to plan treatment and conduct therapy sessions. Sally is a nearly ideal patient and allows me to present cognitive behavior therapy in a straightforward manner. I make some note of how to vary treatment for patients who do not respond as well as she, but the reader must look elsewhere (e. g. , J. S. Beck, 2005; Kuyken, Padesky & Dudley, 2009; Needleman, 1999) to learn how to conceptualize, strategize, and implement techniques for patients with diagnoses other than depres -sion or for patients whose problems pose a challenge in treatment. “Sally” was an 18-year-old single female when she sought treatment with me during her second semester of college. She had been Introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy 7 feeling quite depressed and anxious for the previous 4 months and was having difficulty with her daily activities. She met criteria for a major depressive episode of moderate severity according to DSM-IV-TR (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor -ders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision ; American Psychiatric Associa -tion, 2000). A fuller portrait of Sally is provided in Appendix A. The basic principles of cognitive behavior therapy are as follows:Principle No. 1. Cognitive behavior therapy is based on an ever-evolving formulation of patients’ problems and an individual conceptualization of each patient in cognitive terms . I consider Sally’s difficulties in three time frames. From the beginning, I identify her current thinking that contrib -utes to her feelings of sadness (“I’m a failure, I can’t do anything right, I’ll never be happy”), and her problematic behaviors (isolating herself, spending a great deal of unproductive time in her room, avoiding ask -ing for help). These problematic behaviors both flow from and in turn reinforce Sally’s dysfunctional thinking. Second, I identify precipitating factors that influenced Sally’s perceptions at the onset of her depression (e. g. , being away from home for the first time and struggling in her studies contributed to her belief that she was incompetent). Third, I hypothesize about key developmental events and her enduring patterns of interpreting these events that may have predisposed her to depression (e. g. , Sally has had a lifelong tendency to attribute personal strengths and achievement to luck, but views her weaknesses as a reflection of her “true” self). I base my conceptualization of Sally on the cognitive formulation of depression and on the data Sally provides at the evaluation session. I continue to refine this conceptualization at each session as I obtain more data. At strategic points, I share the conceptualization with Sally to ensure that it “rings true” to her. Moreover, throughout therapy I help Sally view her experience through the cognitive model. She learns, for example, to identify the thoughts associated with her distressing affect and to evaluate and formulate more adaptive responses to her thinking. Doing so improves how she feels and often leads to her behav -ing in a more functional way. Principle No. 2. Cognitive behavior therapy requires a sound therapeu -tic alliance . Sally, like many patients with uncomplicated depression and anxiety disorders, has little difficulty trusting and working with me. I strive to demonstrate all the basic ingredients necessary in a counseling situation: warmth, empathy, caring, genuine regard, and competence. I show my regard for Sally by making empathic statements, listening closely and carefully, and accurately summarizing her thoughts and 8 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND feelings. I point out her small and larger successes and maintain a real -istically optimistic and upbeat outlook. I also ask Sally for feedback at the end of each session to ensure that she feels understood and posi -tive about the session. See Chapter 2 for a lengthier description of the therapeutic relationship in cognitive behavior therapy. Principle No. 3. Cognitive behavior therapy emphasizes collaboration and active participation . I encourage Sally to view therapy as teamwork; together we decide what to work on each session, how often we should meet, and what Sally can do between sessions for therapy homework. At first, I am more active in suggesting a direction for therapy sessions and in summarizing what we’ve discussed during a session. As Sally becomes less depressed and more socialized into treatment, I encourage her to become increasingly active in the therapy session: deciding which prob -lems to talk about, identifying the distortions in her thinking, summa -rizing important points, and devising homework assignments. Principle No. 4. Cognitive behavior therapy is goal oriented and problem focused . I ask Sally in our first session to enumerate her problems and set specific goals so both she and I have a shared understanding of what she is working toward. For example, Sally mentions in the evaluation session that she feels isolated. With my guidance, Sally states a goal in behavioral terms: to initiate new friendships and spend more time with current friends. Later, when discussing how to improve her day-to-day routine, I help her evaluate and respond to thoughts that interfere with her goal, such as: My friends won’t want to hang out with me. I’m too tired to go out with them . First, I help Sally evaluate the validity of her thoughts through an examination of the evidence. Then Sally is willing to test the thoughts more directly through behavioral experiments (pages 217–218) in which she initiates plans with friends. Once she recognizes and corrects the distortion in her thinking, Sally is able to benefit from straightforward problem solving to decrease her isolation. Principle No. 5. Cognitive behavior therapy initially emphasizes the pres -ent. The treatment of most patients involves a strong focus on current problems and on specific situations that are distressing to them. Sally begins to feel better once she is able to respond to her negative think -ing and take steps to improve her life. Therapy starts with an examina -tion of here-and-now problems, regardless of diagnosis. Attention shifts to the past in two circumstances. One, when patients express a strong preference to do so, and a failure to do so could endanger the therapeu -tic alliance. Two, when patients get “stuck” in their dysfunctional think -ing, and an understanding of the childhood roots of their beliefs can potentially help them modify their rigid ideas. (“Well, no wonder you Introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy 9 still believe you’re incompetent. Can you see how almost any child—who had the same experiences as you—would grow up believing she was incompetent, and yet it might not be true, or certainly not com -pletely true? ”)For example, I briefly turn to the past midway through treatment to help Sally identify a set of beliefs she learned as a child: “If I achieve highly, it means I’m worthwhile, ” and “If I don’t achieve highly, it means I’m a failure. ” I help her evaluate the validity of these beliefs both in the past and present. Doing so leads Sally, in part, to develop more functional and more reasonable beliefs. If Sally had had a personal -ity disorder, I would have spent proportionally more time discussing her developmental history and childhood origin of beliefs and coping behaviors. Principle No. 6. Cognitive behavior therapy is educative, aims to teach the patient to be her own therapist, and emphasizes relapse prevention . In our first session I educate Sally about the nature and course of her dis -order, about the process of cognitive behavior therapy, and about the cognitive model (i. e. , how her thoughts influence her emotions and behavior). I not only help Sally set goals, identify and evaluate thoughts and beliefs, and plan behavioral change, but I also teach her how to do so. At each session I ensure that Sally takes home therapy notes—important ideas she has learned—so she can benefit from her new understanding in the ensuing weeks and after treatment ends. Principle No. 7. Cognitive behavior therapy aims to be time limited . Many straightforward patients with depression and anxiety disorders are treated for six to 14 sessions. Therapists’ goals are to provide symptom relief, facilitate a remission of the disorder, help patients resolve their most pressing problems, and teach them skills to avoid relapse. Sally initially has weekly therapy sessions. (Had her depression been more severe or had she been suicidal, I may have arranged more frequent sessions. ) After 2 months, we collaboratively decide to experiment with biweekly sessions, then with monthly sessions. Even after termination, we plan periodic “booster” sessions every 3 months for a year. Not all patients make enough progress in just a few months, how -ever. Some patients require 1 or 2 years of therapy (or possibly longer) to modify very rigid dysfunctional beliefs and patterns of behavior that contribute to their chronic distress. Other patients with severe mental illness may need periodic treatment for a very long time to maintain stabilization. Principle No. 8. Cognitive behavior therapy sessions are structured . No matter what the diagnosis or stage of treatment, following a certain 10 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND structure in each session maximizes efficiency and effectiveness. This structure includes an introductory part (doing a mood check, briefly reviewing the week, collaboratively setting an agenda for the session), a middle part (reviewing homework, discussing problems on the agenda, setting new homework, summarizing), and a final part (eliciting feed -back). Following this format makes the process of therapy more under -standable to patients and increases the likelihood that they will be able to do self-therapy after termination. Principle No. 9. Cognitive behavior therapy teaches patients to identify, evaluate, and respond to their dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs . Patients can have many dozens or even hundreds of automatic thoughts a day that affect their mood, behavior, and/or physiology (the last is espe -cially pertinent to anxiety). Therapists help patients identify key cog -nitions and adopt more realistic, adaptive perspectives, which leads patients to feel better emotionally, behave more functionally, and/or decrease their physiological arousal. They do so through the process of guided discovery , using questioning (often labeled or mislabeled as “Socratic questioning”) to evaluate their thinking (rather than persua -sion, debate, or lecturing). Therapists also create experiences, called behavioral experiments , for patients to directly test their thinking (e. g. , “If I even look at a picture of a spider, I’ll get so anxious I won’t be able to think”). In these ways, therapists engage in collaborative empiricism . Therapists do not generally know in advance to what degree a patient’s automatic thought is valid or invalid, but together they test the patient’s thinking to develop more helpful and accurate responses. When Sally was quite depressed, she had many automatic thoughts throughout the day, some of which she spontaneously reported and oth -ers that I elicited (by asking her what was going through her mind when she felt upset or acted in a dysfunctional manner). We often uncovered important automatic thoughts as we were discussing one of Sally’s spe -cific problems, and together we investigated their validity and utility. I asked her to summarize her new viewpoints, and we recorded them in writing so that she could read these adaptive responses throughout the week to prepare her for these or similar automatic thoughts. I did not encourage her to uncritically adopt a more positive viewpoint, chal -lenge the validity of her automatic thoughts, or try to convince her that her thinking was unrealistically pessimistic. Instead we engaged in a collaborative exploration of the evidence. Principle No. 10. Cognitive behavior therapy uses a variety of tech -niques to change thinking, mood, and behavior . Although cognitive strate -gies such as Socratic questioning and guided discovery are central to cognitive behavior therapy, behavioral and problem-solving techniques Introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy 11 are essential, as are techniques from other orientations that are imple -mented within a cognitive framework. For example, I used Gestalt-inspired techniques to help Sally understand how experiences with her family contributed to the development of her belief that she was incom -petent. I use psychodynamically inspired techniques with some Axis II patients who apply their distorted ideas about people to the therapeutic relationship. The types of techniques you select will be influenced by your conceptualization of the patient, the problem you are discussing, and your objectives for the session. These basic principles apply to all patients. Therapy does, however, vary considerably according to individual patients, the nature of their difficulties, and their stage of life, as well as their developmental and intellectual level, gender, and cultural background. Treatment also var -ies depending on patients’ goals, their ability to form a strong thera -peutic bond, their motivation to change, their previous experience with therapy, and their preferences for treatment, among other factors. The emphasis in treatment also depends on the patient’s particu -lar disorder(s). Cognitive behavior therapy for panic disorder involves testing the patient’s catastrophic misinterpretations (usually life- or sanity-threatening erroneous predictions) of bodily or mental sensa -tions (Clark, 1989). Anorexia requires a modification of beliefs about personal worth and control (Garner & Bemis, 1985). Substance abuse treatment focuses on negative beliefs about the self and facilitating or permission-granting beliefs about substance use (Beck, Wright, New -man, & Liese, 1993). WHAT I S A T HERAPY S ESSION l I k E? The structure of therapy sessions is quite similar for the various disor -ders, but interventions can vary considerably from patient to patient. (The website of the Academy of Cognitive Therapy [ www. academyofct. org] posts a list of books that describe the cognitive formulation, major emphases, strategies, and techniques for a wide range of diagnoses, patient variables, and treatment formats and settings. ) Below is a gen -eral description of treatment sessions and the course of treatment, especially for patients who are depressed. At the beginning of sessions, you will reestablish the therapeutic alliance, check on patients’ mood, symptoms, and experiences in the past week, and ask them to name the problems they most want help in solving. These difficulties may have arisen during the week and/or they may be problems patients expect to encounter in the coming week(s). You will also review the self-help activities (“homework” or 12 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND “action plan”) patients engaged in since the previous session. Then, in the context of discussing a specific problem patients have put on the agenda, you will collect data about the problem, cognitively conceptu -alize patients’ difficulties (asking for their specific thoughts, emotions, and behaviors associated with the problem), and collaboratively plan a strategy. The strategy most often includes straightforward problem solving, evaluating patients’ negative thinking associated with the prob -lem, and/or behavior change. For example, Sally, the college student, is having difficulty studying. She needs help evaluating and responding to her thoughts (“What’s the use? I’ll probably flunk out anyway”) before she is able to fully engage in solving her problem with studying. I make sure Sally has adopted a more accurate and adaptive view of the situation and has decided which solutions to implement in the coming week (e. g. , starting with relatively easier tasks, mentally summarizing what she has read after every page or two of reading, planning shorter study sessions, going for walks when she takes breaks, and asking the teaching assistant for help). Our ses -sion sets the stage for Sally to make changes in her thinking and behav -ior during the coming week that, in turn, lead to an improvement in her mood and functioning. Having discussed a problem and collaboratively set therapy home -work, Sally and I turn to a second problem she has put on the agenda and repeat the process. At the end of the session we review important points from the session. I make sure that Sally is highly likely to do the homework assignments, and I elicit her feedback about the session. DEVEl OPING AS A C OGNITIVE B EHAVIOR T HERAPISTTo the untrained observer, cognitive behavior therapy sometimes appears deceptively simple. The cognitive model , the proposition that one’s thoughts influence one’s emotions and behavior, is quite straight -forward. Experienced cognitive behavior therapists, however, accom -plish many tasks at once: conceptualizing the case, building rapport, socializing and educating the patient, identifying problems, collect -ing data, testing hypotheses, and summarizing. The novice cognitive behavior therapist, in contrast, usually needs to be more deliberate and structured, concentrating on fewer elements at one time. Although the ultimate goal is to interweave these elements and conduct therapy as effectively and efficiently as possible, beginners must first learn the skill of developing the therapeutic relationship, the skill of conceptualiza -tion, and the techniques of cognitive behavior therapy, all of which is best done in a step-by-step manner. Developing expertise as a cognitive behavior therapist can be viewed in three stages. (These descriptions assume that the therapist Introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy 13 is already proficient in basic counseling skills: listening, empathy, con -cern, positive regard, and genuineness, as well as accurate understand -ing, reflection, and summarizing. Therapists who do not already possess these skills often elicit a negative reaction from patients. ) In Stage 1 you learn basic skills of conceptualizing a case in cognitive terms based on an intake evaluation and data collected in session. You also learn to structure the session, use your conceptualization of a patient and good common sense to plan treatment, and help patients solve problems and view their dysfunctional thoughts in a different way. You also learn to use basic cognitive and behavioral techniques. In Stage 2 you become more proficient at integrating your con -ceptualization with your knowledge of techniques. You strengthen your ability to understand the flow of therapy. You become more easily able to identify critical goals of treatment and more skillful at conceptual -izing patients, refining your conceptualization during the therapy ses -sion itself, and using the conceptualization to make decisions about interventions. You expand your repertoire of techniques and become more proficient in selecting, timing, and implementing appropriate techniques. In Stage 3 you more automatically integrate new data into the conceptualization. You refine your ability to make hypotheses to con -firm or revise your view of the patient. You vary the structure and tech -niques of basic cognitive behavior therapy as appropriate, particularly for patients with personality disorders and other difficult disorders and problems. If you already practice in another psychotherapeutic modality, it will be important for you to make a collaborative decision with patients to introduce the cognitive behavior therapy approach, describing what you would like to do differently and providing a rationale. Most patients agree to such changes when they are phrased positively, to the patient’s benefit. When patients are hesitant, you can suggest the institution of a change (such as setting an agenda) as an “experiment, ” rather than a commitment, to motivate them to try it. Th e r a p i s T: Mike, I was reading an important book on making therapy more effective and I thought of you. pa Ti e n T: Oh? Th e r a p i s T: Yes, and I have some ideas about how we can help you get better faster. [being collaborative] Is it okay if I tell you about it? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: One thing I read was called “setting the agenda. ” That means at the beginning of sessions, I’m going to ask you tell me the names of problems you want my help in solving during the session. For example, you might say that you’re having a problem with your 14 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND boss, or with getting out of bed on weekends, or that you’ve been feeling really anxious about your finances. ( pause ) By asking you the names of problems up front, we can figure out how to spend our time in session better. ( pause ) [eliciting feedback] How does that sound? HOW TO U SE THIS B OOk This book is intended for individuals at any stage of experience and skill development who lack mastery in the fundamental building blocks of cognitive conceptualization and treatment. It is critical to have mastered the basic elements of cognitive behavior therapy in order to understand how and when to vary standard treatment for individual patients. Your growth as a cognitive behavior therapist will be enhanced if you start applying the tools described in this book to yourself. First, as you read, begin to conceptualize your own thoughts and beliefs. Start paying attention to your own shifts in affect. When you notice that your mood has changed or intensified in a negative direction (or when you notice that you are engaging in dysfunctional behavior or are experi -encing bodily sensations associated with negative affect), ask yourself what emotion you are feeling, as well as the cardinal question of cogni -tive behavior therapy:“What was just going through my mind? ”In this way, you will teach yourself to identify your own automatic thoughts. Teaching yourself the basic skills of cognitive behavior ther -apy using yourself as the subject will enhance your ability to teach your patients these same skills. It will be particularly useful to identify your automatic thoughts as you are reading this book and trying techniques with your patients. If, for instance, you find yourself feeling slightly distressed, ask yourself, “What was just going through my mind? ” You may uncover automatic thoughts such as:“This is too hard. ”“I may not be able to master this. ”“This doesn’t feel comfortable to me. ”“What if I try it and it doesn’t work? ” Introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy 15 Experienced therapists whose primary orientation has not been cognitive may be aware of a different set of automatic thoughts:“This won’t work. ”“The patient won’t like it. ”“It’s too superficial/structured/unempathic/simple. ”Having uncovered your thoughts, you can note them and refocus on your reading, or turn to Chapters 11 and 12, which describe how to evaluate and respond to automatic thoughts. By turning the spotlight on your own thinking, not only can you boost your cognitive behavior therapy skills, but you can also take the opportunity to modify dysfunc -tional thoughts and positively influence your mood (and behavior), making you more receptive to learning. A common analogy used for patients also applies to the beginning cognitive behavior therapist. Learning the skills of cognitive behavior therapy is similar to learning any other skill. Do you remember learn -ing how to drive or how to use a computer? At first, did you feel a little awkward? Did you have to pay a great deal of attention to small details and motions that now come smoothly and automatically to you? Did you ever feel discouraged? As you progressed, did the process make more and more sense, and feel more and more comfortable? Did you finally master it to the point where you were able to perform the task with relative ease and confidence? Most people have had just such an experience learning a skill in which they are now proficient. The learning process is the same for the beginning cognitive behavior therapist. As you will learn to do for your patients, keep your goals small, well-defined, and realistic. Give yourself credit for small gains. Compare your progress to your ability level before you started reading this book, or to the time you first started learning about cog -nitive behavior therapy. Be cognizant of opportunities to respond to negative thoughts in which you unfairly compare yourself to experi -enced cognitive behavior therapists, or in which you undermine your confidence by contrasting your current level of skill with your ultimate objectives. If you feel anxious about starting to use cognitive behavior therapy with patients, make yourself a “coping card, ” an index card on which you have written statements that are important to remember. My psychi -atric residents often have unhelpful thoughts before they see their first outpatient. I ask them to create a card that addresses these thoughts. The card is individualized but generally says something such as: 16 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND My goal is not to cure this patient today. No one expects me to. My goal is to establish a good working alliance, to do some problemsolving if I can, and to sharpen my cognitive behavior therapy skills. Reading this card helps reduce their anxiety so that they can focus on their patients and be more effective. Finally, the chapters of this book are designed to be read in the order presented. You might be eager to skip over introductory chapters in order to jump to the sections on techniques. The sum of cognitive behavior therapy, however, is not merely the employment of cognitive and behavioral techniques. Among other attributes, it entails the artful selection and effective utilization of a wide variety of techniques based on one’s conceptualization of the patient. The next chapter provides an overview of treatment, followed by an initial chapter on conceptual -ization. Chapter 4 describes the evaluation process, and Chapters 5–8 focus on how to structure and what to do in therapy sessions. Chapters 9–14 describe the basic building blocks of cognitive behavior therapy: identifying cognitions and emotions and adaptively responding to auto -matic thoughts and beliefs. Additional cognitive and behavioral tech -niques are provided in Chapter 15, and imagery is discussed in Chap -ter 16. Chapter 17 describes homework. Chapter 18 outlines issues of termination and relapse prevention. These preceding chapters lay the groundwork for Chapters 19 and 20: planning treatment and diagnos -ing problems in therapy. Finally, Chapter 21 offers guidelines in pro -gressing as a cognitive behavior therapist. 17 Chapter 2 OVERVIEW Of TREATm ENTThis chapter briefl y describes cognitive behavior therapy treatment and introduces several essential streams that run through each therapy session. They are:Developing the therapeutic relationship. • Planning treatment and structuring sessions. • Identifying and responding to dysfunctional cognitions. • Emphasizing the positive. • facilitating cognitive and behavioral change between • sessions (homework). You will also learn more about each of these elements in future chapters. DEVEl OPING THE THERAPEUTIC REl ATIONSHIPIt is essential to start building trust and rapport with patients from your fi rst contact with them. Research demonstrates that positive alliances are correlated with positive treatment outcomes (Raue & Goldfried, 1994). This ongoing process is easily accomplished with most patients 18 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND (although it can be more difficult with patients with severe mental ill -ness or those with strong Axis II pathology). To accomplish this goal, you will:Demonstrate good counseling skills and accurate • understanding. Share your conceptualization and treatment plan. • Collaboratively make decisions. • Seek feedback. • Vary your style. • Help patients solve their problems and alleviate their distress. • Demonstrating Good Counseling Skills You will continuously demonstrate your commitment to and under -standing of patients through your empathic statements, choice of words, tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language. As I tell my trainees, you strive to be a nice human being in the room with patients. You treat them the way you would like to be treated. You demonstrate empathy and accurate comprehension of their problems and ideas through your thoughtful questions, reflections, and statements, which leads to their feeling valued and understood. You will try to impart the following implicit (and sometimes explicit) messages, but only when you genuinely endorse them:“I care about you and value you. ”“I want to understand what you are experiencing and help you. ”“I’m confident we can work well together and that cognitive behavior therapy will help. ”“I’m not overwhelmed by your problems, even though you might be. ” “I’ve helped other patients much like you. ”If you cannot honestly endorse these messages, you may need help from a supervisor to respond to your automatic thoughts about the patient, about cognitive behavior therapy, or about yourself. Through the relationship, you can indirectly help depressed patients: Overview of Treatment 19 feel likeable, when you are warm, friendly, and interested. • feel less alone, when you describe the process of working • together as a team to solve their problems and work toward their goals. feel more optimistic, as you present yourself as realistically • hopeful that treatment will help. feel a greater sense of self-efficacy, when you help them see • how much credit they deserve for solving problems, doing homework, and engaging in other productive activities. A common myth about cognitive behavior therapy, held by people who have not read the seminal books or watched videotapes of master clini -cians, is that it is conducted in a cold, mechanical fashion. This is sim -ply inaccurate. In fact, the earliest cognitive behavior therapy manual (Beck et al. , 1979) stressed the importance of developing a good thera -peutic relationship. Sharing Your Conceptualization and Treatment Plan You will continuously share your conceptualization with patients and ask them whether it “rings true. ” For example, a patient may have just described a problem with her mother. You have questioned her to fill in the cognitive model. Then you conceptualize aloud, in summary form. “Okay, I want to make sure I understand. The situation was that your mother yelled at you on the phone for not calling your brother, and your automatic thought was, ‘She doesn’t realize how busy I am. She doesn’t blame him for not calling me. ’ These thoughts led you to feel hurt and angry, but you didn’t say anything back to her [behavior]. . . . Did I get that right? ” If your conceptualization is accurate, the patient invariably says, “Yes, I think that’s right. ” If you are wrong, the patient usually says, “No, it’s not exactly like that. It’s more like . . . ” Eliciting patients’ feedback strengthens the alliance and allows you to more accurately conceptualize them and conduct effective treatment. Making Collaborative Decisions While you guide patients during sessions, you will also actively enlist their participation. You will help them prioritize the problems they want help in solving during a session. You will provide rationales for interven -tions and elicit their approval (“I think it may reduce your stress if you take a rest a couple of times a day—is it okay if we talk about that? ”). 20 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND You may suggest, and elicit their reaction to, some self-help activities they can try at home. You continuously act as a team. Seeking Feedback You will be continuously alert for your patients’ emotional reactions throughout the session, observing their facial expressions, body lan -guage, choice of words, and tone of voice. When you recognize that patients are experiencing increased distress, you will often address the issue at the time: “You look upset. What was just going through your mind? ” You may find that patients express negative thoughts about themselves, the process of therapy, or you. As described in Chapter 8, it is important to positively reinforce patients for providing feedback, then conceptualize the problem and plan a strategy to solve it. Failure to identify and address patients’ negative feedback reduces their ability to focus on solving their real-life difficulties and feel better. They may even decide not to return to therapy the following week. (See J. S. Beck, 2005, for an extensive discussion of solving problems in the therapeutic relationship. )Even when you discern that your alliance with patients is strong, you will still elicit feedback from them at the end of sessions: “What did you think about the session? Was there anything that bothered you, or you thought I misunderstood? Is there anything you want to do differ -ently next time? ” Asking these questions can strengthen the alliance significantly. You may be the first health or mental health professional who has ever asked the patient for feedback. Patients usually feel hon -ored and respected by your genuine concern for their reactions. Varying Your Style Most patients will respond positively to you when you are warm, empathic, and caring. However, an occasional patient might have a neg -ative reaction. For example, a patient may perceive you as being overly caring or too “touchy-feely. ” Watching for patients’ emotional reactions in the session can alert you to ask questions to elicit a problem such as this, so you can change how you present yourself and help the patient feel more comfortable working with you. Helping Patients Alleviate Their Distress One of the best ways to strengthen the therapeutic relationship is by being an effective and competent cognitive behavior therapist. Research has demonstrated that the therapeutic alliance becomes strengthened Overview of Treatment 21 when patients’ symptomatology is reduced (De Rubeis & Feeley, 1990; Feeley, De Rubeis, & Gelfand, 1999). In general, you will spend enough time developing the therapeu -tic relationship to engage patients in working effectively with you as a team, and you will use the therapeutic alliance to provide evidence to patients that their core beliefs are incorrect. If the alliance is sound, you will avoid spending additional unnecessary time in order to maximize the time you spend helping patients solve problems they will face in the coming week. Some patients, particularly those with personality disor -ders, do require a far greater emphasis on the therapeutic relationship and advanced strategies to forge a good working alliance (Beck, Free -man, Davis, & Associates, 2004; J. S. Beck, 2005; Young, 1999). Pl ANNING T REAT m ENT AND S TRUCTURING S ESSIONSA major goal of treatment is to make the process of therapy understand -able to you and the patient. You will try to conduct therapy as efficiently as possible, so you can alleviate the patient’s suffering as quickly as pos -sible. Adhering to a standard format (as well as teaching the tools of therapy to the patient) facilitates these objectives. But, as noted above, you will not deliver treatment in a rote or impersonal way—if you did, you would not be very effective. Most patients feel more comfortable when they know what to expect from therapy, when they clearly understand what you want them to do, when they feel that you and they are a team, and when they have a con -crete idea of how therapy will proceed, both within a session and over the course of treatment. You will maximize the patient’s understanding by explaining the general structure of sessions and then adhering (flex -ibly at times) to that structure. You will begin to plan treatment for a session before patients enter your office. You will quickly review their chart, especially their goals for treatment and the therapy notes and homework assignments from the previous session(s). As noted above, you will have a general idea of how you intend to structure the session. The overarching therapeutic goal is to improve the patient’s mood during the session and to create a plan so the patient can feel better and behave more functionally during the week. What you will do specifically in the session will be influenced by patients’ symptoms, your conceptualization, the strength of the thera -peutic alliance, their stage of treatment, and, especially, the problems they put on the agenda. Your goal in the first part of a therapy session is to reestablish the therapeutic alliance and collect data so you and the patient can collab - 22 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND oratively set and prioritize the agenda. In the second part of a session, you and the patient will discuss the problems on the agenda. In the con -text of solving these problems, you will teach the patient relevant cogni -tive, behavioral, problem-solving, and other skills. You will continually reinforce the cognitive model, help patients evaluate and respond to their automatic thoughts, do problem solving, and ask them to summa -rize their new understandings. These kinds of discussions and interventions naturally lead to homework assignments, which usually involve having patients remind themselves of their new, more realistic way of thinking about the prob -lem and implementing solutions during the week. One important ongo -ing assignment is to have patients identify and respond to their dysfunc -tional thinking throughout the week, when they notice their mood is getting worse, they are behaving in a dysfunctional way, and/or they are experiencing significant physiological arousal. In the final part of the session, you will elicit from patients what they thought were the most important points of the session, ensure that these ideas are written down, review (and modify if necessary) the homework assignments, and elicit and respond to patients’ feedback about the session. While experienced cognitive behavior therapists may deviate from this format at times, novice therapists are usually more effective when they follow the specified structure. Further descriptions of the structure of therapy sessions appear in Chapters 5, 7, and 8. To structure sessions effectively, you will need to gently interrupt patients: “Oh, can I interrupt you for a moment? Are you saying. . . ? ” Strategically and skillfully interrupting patients is illustrated in later chapters. If you initially feel awkward with a more tightly structured session, you will most likely find that the process gradually becomes second nature, especially when you note the positive results. IDENTI f YING AND R ESPONDING TO D YSf UNCTIONA l COGNITIONSAn important part of nearly every therapy session is to help patients respond to their inaccurate or unhelpful ideas: their automatic thoughts, images (mental pictures), and/or underlying beliefs. You can identify important automatic thoughts in several ways (see Chapter 9), but you will usually ask a basic question when a patient is reporting a distressing situation or emotion, or dysfunctional behavior:“What is going through your mind right now? ” Overview of Treatment 23 Next, you will help patients evaluate their thinking in two major ways:You will engage in a process of • guided discovery to help patients develop a more adaptive and reality-based perspective. You will jointly design • behavioral experiments to test patients’ pre -dictions whenever feasible. Guided Discovery Usually in the context of discussing a problem, you elicit patients’ cog -nitions (automatic thoughts, images, and/or beliefs). You will often ascertain which cognition or cognitions are most upsetting to patients, then ask them a series of questions to help them gain distance (i. e. , see their cognitions as ideas, not necessarily as truths), evaluate the valid -ity and utility of their cognitions, and/or decastastrophize their fears. Questions such as the following are often helpful:“What is the evidence that your thought is true? What is the evidence on the other side? ”“What is an alternative way of viewing this situation? ”“What is the worst that could happen, and how could you cope if it did? What’s the best that could happen? What’s the most realistic outcome of this situation? ”“What is the effect of believing your automatic thought, and what could be the effect of changing your thinking? ”“If your [friend or family member] were in this situation and had the same automatic thought, what advice would you give him or her? ”“What should you do? ”As described in Chapter 11, not all these questions apply to all auto -matic thoughts, and you might often use a different line of questioning altogether. But these questions are a useful guide, and are illustrated in the following transcript, excerpted from Sally’s fourth therapy session. I help Sally specify a problem that is important to her, identify and eval -uate an associated dysfunctional idea, devise a reasonable plan, and assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, Sally, you said you wanted to talk about a problem with finding a part-time job? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. I need the money . . . but I don’t know. 24 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: (noticing that Sally looks more dysphoric ) What’s going through your mind right now? pa Ti e n T: [automatic thought] I won’t be able to handle a job. Th e r a p i s T: [labeling her idea as a thought and linking it to her mood] And how does that thought make you feel? pa Ti e n T: [emotion] Sad. Really low. Th e r a p i s T: [beginning to evaluate the thought] What’s the evidence that you won’t be able to work? pa Ti e n T: Well, I’m having trouble just getting through my classes. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. What else? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know . . . I’m still so tired. It’s hard to make myself even go and look for a job, much less go to work every day. Th e r a p i s T: In a minute we’ll look at that. [suggesting an alterna -tive view] Maybe it’s actually harder for you at this point to go out and investigate jobs than it would be for you to go to a job that you already had. In any case, is there any other evidence that you couldn’t handle a job, assuming that you can get one? pa Ti e n T: . . . No, not that I can think of. Th e r a p i s T: Any evidence on the other side? That you might be able to handle a job? pa Ti e n T: I did work last year. And that was on top of school and other activities. But this year . . . I just don’t know. Th e r a p i s T: Any other evidence that you could handle a job? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. . . . It’s possible I could do something that doesn’t take much time. And that isn’t too hard. Th e r a p i s T: What might that be? pa Ti e n T: A sales job, maybe. I did that last year. Th e r a p i s T: Any ideas of where you could work? pa Ti e n T: Actually, maybe the [university] bookstore. I saw a notice that they’re looking for new clerks. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. And what would be the worst that could happen if you did get a job at the bookstore? pa Ti e n T: I guess if I couldn’t do it. Th e r a p i s T: And if that happened, how would you cope? pa Ti e n T: I guess I’d just quit. Th e r a p i s T: And what would be the best that could happen? pa Ti e n T: Uh . . . that I’d be able to do it easily. Overview of Treatment 25 Th e r a p i s T: And what’s the most realistic outcome? pa Ti e n T: It probably won’t be easy, especially at first. But I might be able to do it. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, what’s the effect of believing your thought, “I won’t be able to handle a job”? pa Ti e n T: Makes me feel sad. . . . Makes me not even try. Th e r a p i s T: And what’s the effect of changing your thinking, of real -izing that possibly you could work in the bookstore? pa Ti e n T: I’d feel better. I’d be more likely to apply for the job. Th e r a p i s T: So what do you want to do about this? pa Ti e n T: Go to the bookstore. I could go this afternoon. Th e r a p i s T: How likely are you to go? pa Ti e n T: Oh, I guess I will. I will go. Th e r a p i s T: And how do you feel now? pa Ti e n T: A little better. A little more nervous, maybe. But a little more hopeful, I guess. Here Sally is easily able to identify and evaluate her dysfunctional thought, “I won’t be able to handle a job, ” with standard questions. Many patients, though, may require far more therapeutic effort before they are willing to follow through behaviorally. Had Sally been hesitant, I might have asked her to summarize what we had discussed and then we may have jointly composed a coping card based on her summary, that might have said something such as:If I avoid going to the bookstore, remind myself that I probablycould handle a job there and I could always quit if it didn’t work out. It’s not a big deal. 26 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Behavioral Experiments Whenever possible, you will collaboratively design experiments that patients can conduct right in the therapy session itself (as well as between sessions). Discussing the validity of patients’ ideas, as described above, can help them change their thinking, but the change may be signifi -cantly more profound if the cognition is amenable to a behavioral test, that is, if the patient can have an experience that disconfirms its valid -ity (Bennett-Levy et al. , 2004). Suitable cognitions are usually linked to patients’ negative predictions. A depressed patient, for example, might have the automatic thought, “If I try to read anything, I won’t be able to concentrate well enough to understand it. ” You might ask the patient to read a short passage from a book in your office to see to what degree this thought is valid. An anxious patient may express the thought, “If I tell you about the abuse, I’ll be so upset, I’ll fall apart, ” or “If I get anxious and my heart starts to pound, I’ll have a heart attack. ” You will collaboratively design experiments to test these kinds of ideas. At the beginning of treatment, you will generally focus on situation-specific thoughts, which are usually amenable to change. Toward the middle of therapy, you will continue to work at the automatic thought level, but you will also focus on modifying patients’ more generalized cognitions: their underlying assumptions and core beliefs. (These vari -ous levels of cognition are described at length in the next chapter. ) Treatment continues, ideally, until patients’ disorders are in remission and they have learned the necessary skills to prevent relapse. Em PHASI z ING THE P OSITIVEMost patients, especially those with depression, tend to focus unduly on the negative. When they are in a depressive mode, they automati -cally (i. e. , without conscious awareness) and selectively attend to and put great emphasis on negative experience, and they either discount or fail to recognize more positive experience. Their difficulty in process -ing positive data in a straightforward manner leads them to develop a distorted sense of reality. To counteract this feature of depression, you will continually help patients attend to the positive. At the evaluation, you will elicit patients’ strengths (“What are some of your strengths and positive qualities? ”). From the first session on, you will elicit positive data from the preceding week (“What posi -tive things happened since I saw you last? What positive things did you do? ”). You will orient sessions toward the positive, helping patients have a better week. You will use the therapeutic alliance to demonstrate that you view patients as valuable human beings (“I think it’s great that you Overview of Treatment 27 talked to the teacher [of the child you were tutoring] to see whether he could get more help”). You will ask patients for data that is contrary to their negative automatic thoughts and beliefs (“What’s the [positive] evidence on the other side, that perhaps your automatic thought isn’t true? ”). You will point out the positive data you hear as patients discuss problems and ask what this data means about them (“What does this say about you, that you got the job in the bookstore? ”). You will be on alert for, and note aloud, instances of positive coping that patients may allude to throughout the session (“What a good idea, to solve the problem by asking Allison to study with you”). You will collaboratively set homework assignments with patients to facilitate their experienc -ing a sense of pleasure and achievement. Methods of conceptualizing and incorporating patients’ strengths as well as building resilience are described in Kuyken et al. (2009). f ACI l ITATING C OGNITIVE AND B EHAVIORA l CHANGE BETWEEN S ESSIONS (H Om EWOR k)An important aim of treatment is to help patients feel better by the end of the session and to set them up to have a better week. To achieve this objective, you will:Help patients evaluate and respond to automatic thoughts • that they are likely to experience between sessions. Help patients devise solutions to their problems to • implement during the week. Teach patients new skills to practice during the week. • Because patients tend to forget much of what occurs in therapy sessions, it is important that anything you want them to remember be recorded so they can review it at home. Either you or they should write down their self-help assignments in a therapy notebook (which you can photocopy and attach to your treatment notes) or on carbonless paper (available from office supply stores or printers). Homework usually con -sists of:Behavioral changes as a result of problem solving and/or skills • training in session (e. g. , problem of isolation might lead to behavioral solution of calling friends; problem of being overloaded 28 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND at work might lead to patient’s assertively discussing the difficulty with a supervisor). Identifying automatic thoughts and beliefs when patients notice a • dysfunctional change in affect, behavior, or physiology, and then evaluating and responding to their cognitions through Socratic questioning, behavioral experiments, and/or reading therapy notes that address their cognitions. f or example:If I start to think that I can’t clean up the kitchen, remind myselfthat I’m only going to do it for 10 minutes, that it may be difficultbut probably won’t be impossible, and that the first minute or twowill probably be the hardest, and then it’s likely to get easier. Homework naturally flows from the discussion of each problem, because the patient will have things to remember (changes in cogni -tion) and/or things to do. It is of utmost importance to plan home -work assignments carefully, crafting them for your patient based on your conceptualization of what will help most, along with the patient’s agreement. It is also essential to review homework the following week. An important early assignment for patients with depression is schedul -ing activities. See Chapter 6 for a detailed description of activity sched -uling and Chapter 17 for detailed guidelines in setting and reviewing homework. 29 Chapter 3 COGNITIVE CONCEPTUAl Iz ATIONA cognitive conceptualization provides the framework for under-standing a patient. To initiate the process of formulating a case, you will ask yourself the following questions:“What is the patient’s diagnosis(es)? ”“What are his current problems? How did these problems develop and how are they maintained? ”“What dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs are associated with the problems? What reactions (emotional, physiological, and behavioral) are associated with his thinking? ”Then you will hypothesize how the patient developed this particu-lar psychological disorder:“How does the patient view himself, others, his personal world, his future? ”“What are the patient’s underlying beliefs (including attitudes, expectations, and rules) and thoughts? ”“How is the patient coping with his dysfunctional cognitions? ” 30 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND “What stressors (precipitants) contributed to the development of his current psychological problems, or interfere with solving these problems? ”“If relevant, what early experiences may have contributed to the patient’s current problems? What meaning did the patient glean from these experiences, and which beliefs originated from, or became strengthened by, these experiences? ”“If relevant, what cognitive, affective, and behavioral mechanisms (adaptive and maladaptive) did the patient develop to cope with these dysfunctional beliefs? ”You begin to construct a cognitive conceptualization during your first contact with a patient and continue to refine your conceptualiza -tion throughout treatment. This organic, evolving formulation helps you plan for efficient and effective therapy (Kuyken et al. , 2009; Needle -man, 1999; Persons, 2008; Tarrier, 2006). In this chapter I describe the cognitive model, the theoretical basis of cognitive behavior therapy. I then discuss the relationship of thoughts and beliefs and present the case example of Sally, used throughout this book. THE C OGNITIVE m ODE l Cognitive behavior therapy is based on the cognitive model , which hypoth -esizes that people’s emotions, behaviors, and physiology are influenced by their perception of events. Situation/eventAutomatic thoughtsReaction (emotional, behavioral, physiological)It is not a situation in and of itself that determines what people feel, but rather how they construe a situation (Beck, 1964; Ellis, 1962). Imag-ine, for example, a situation in which several people are reading a basic text on cognitive behavior therapy. They have quite different emotional and behavioral responses to the same situation, based on what is going through their minds as they read. Cognitive Conceptualization 31 Reader A thinks, “This really makes sense. f inally, a book that will really teach me to be a good therapist! ” Reader A feels mildly excited and keeps reading. Reader B, on the other hand, thinks, “This approach is too simplistic. It will never work. ” Reader B feels disappointed and closes the book. Reader C has the following thoughts: “This book isn’t what I expected. What a waste of money. ” Reader C is disgusted and discards the book altogether. Reader D thinks, “I really need to learn all this. What if I don’t understand it? What if I never get good at it? ” Reader D feels anxious and keeps reading the same few pages over and over. Reader E has different thoughts: “This is just too hard. I’m so dumb. I’ll never master this. I’ll never make it as a therapist. ” Reader E feels sad and turns on the television. The way people feel emotionally and the way they behave are asso -ciated with how they interpret and think about a situation. The situation itself does not directly determine how they feel or what they do ; their emotional response is mediated by their perception of the situation. Cognitive behavior therapists are particularly interested in the level of thinking that may operate simultaneously with a more obvious, surface level of thinking. For example, while you are reading this text, you may notice two levels in your thinking. Part of your mind is focusing on the informa -tion in the text; that is, you are trying to understand and integrate the information. At another level, however, you may be having some quick, evaluative thoughts. These thoughts are called automatic thoughts and are not the result of deliberation or reasoning. Rather, these thoughts seem to spring up spontaneously; they are often quite rapid and brief. You may barely be aware of these thoughts; you are far more likely to be aware of the emotion or behavior that follows. Even if you are aware of your thoughts, you most likely accept them uncritically, believing that they are true. You don’t even think of questioning them. You can learn, however, to identify your automatic thoughts by attending to your shifts in affect, your behavior, and/or your physiology. Ask yourself, “What was just going through my mind? ” when: 32 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND You begin to feel dysphoric. • You feel inclined to behave in a dysfunctional way (or to avoid • behaving in an adaptive way). You notice distressing changes in your body or mind. • Having identified your automatic thoughts, you can, and probably already do to some extent, evaluate the validity of your thinking. For example, if you have a lot to do, you may have the automatic thought, “I’ll never get it all finished. ” But you may do an automatic reality check, recalling past experiences and reminding yourself, “It’s okay. You know you always get done what you need to. ” When you find your interpre -tation of a situation is erroneous and you correct it, you probably dis -cover that your mood improves, you behave in a more functional way, and/or your physiological arousal decreases. In cognitive terms, when dysfunctional thoughts are subjected to objective reflection, one’s emo -tions, behavior, and physiological reaction generally change. Chapter 11 offers specific guidelines on how to evaluate automatic thoughts. But where do automatic thoughts spring from? What makes one person construe a situation differently from another person? Why may the same person interpret an identical event differently at one time than at another? The answer has to do with more enduring cognitive phenomena: beliefs. BEl IEf SBeginning in childhood, people develop certain ideas about them -selves, other people, and their world. Their most central or core beliefs are enduring understandings so fundamental and deep that they often do not articulate them, even to themselves. The person regards these ideas as absolute truths—just the way things “are” (Beck, 1987). For example, Reader E, who thought he was too unintelligent to master this text, frequently has a similar concern when he has to engage in a new task (e. g. , learning a new skill on the computer, figuring out how to put together a bookcase, or applying for a bank loan). He seems to have the core belief, “I’m incompetent. ” This belief may operate only when he is in a depressed state, or it may be activated much of the time. When this core belief is activated, Reader E interprets situations through the lens of this belief, even though the interpretation may, on a rational basis, be patently invalid. Reader E tends to focus selectively on information that confirms his core belief, disregarding or discounting information to the con - Cognitive Conceptualization 33 trary. For example, Reader E did not consider that other intelligent, competent people might not fully understand the material in their first reading. Nor did he entertain the possibility that the author had not presented the material well. He did not recognize that his difficulty in comprehension could be due to a lack of concentration, rather than a lack of brainpower. He forgot that he often had difficulty initially when presented with a body of new information, but later had a good track record of mastery. Because his incompetence belief was activated, he automatically interpreted the situation in a highly negative, self-critical way. In this way, his belief is maintained, even though it is inaccurate and dysfunctional. It is important to note that he is not purposely try -ing to process information in this way; it occurs automatically. Figure 3. 1 illustrates this distorted way of processing information. The circle with a rectangular opening represents Reader E’s schema. In Piagetian terms, the schema is a hypothesized mental structure that organizes information. Within this schema is Reader E’s core belief: “I’m incompetent. ” When Reader E is presented with negative data this schema becomes activated, and the data, contained in negative rect -angles, are immediately processed as confirming his core belief, which makes the belief stronger. But a different process occurs when Reader E is presented with posi -tive data (such as analyzing which health care plan would be best for his family). Positive data are encoded in the equivalent of positive triangles, which cannot fit into the schema. His mind automatically discounts the data (“I chose a health care plan, but it took me a long time. ”) When his boss praised him, he immediately thought, “My boss is wrong. I didn’t do that project well. I didn’t deserve it [his praise]. ” These interpreta -tions, in essence, change the shape of the data from positive triangles to negative rectangles. Now the data fit into the schema and, as a result, strengthen the negative core belief. There are also positive data that Reader E just does not notice. He does not negate some evidence of competence, such as paying his bills on time or fixing a plumbing problem. Rather, he does not seem to process these positive data at all; they bounce off the schema. Over time, Reader E’s core belief of incompetence becomes stronger and stronger. Sally, too, has a core belief of incompetence. Fortunately, when she is not depressed a different schema (which contains the core belief, “I’m reasonably competent”) is activated much, but not all, of the time. But when she is depressed, the incompetence schema pre -dominates. One important part of therapy is to help Sally view negative data in a more realistic and adaptive way. Another important part of therapy is to help her identify and process positive data in a straight -forward way. 34 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Core beliefs are the most fundamental level of belief; they are global, rigid, and overgeneralized. Automatic thoughts , the actual words or images that go through a person’s mind, are situation specific and may be considered the most superficial level of cognition. The following section describes the class of intermediate beliefs that exists between the two. –Difficulty with newcomputer skills–Difficulty applyingfor loan–But I didn’t deserve it–But it took mea long time+Praisefrom boss+Chosehealth plan+Paidbills on time+Fixedplumbingproblem I’mincompetent. FIGURE 3. 1. Information-processing model. This diagram demonstrates how negative data are immediately processed, strengthening the core belief, while posi -tive data are discounted (changed into negative data) or unnoticed. Cognitive Conceptualization 35 Attitudes, Rules, and Assumptions Core beliefs influence the development of an intermediate class of beliefs, which consists of (often unarticulated) attitudes, rules, and assumptions. Reader E, for example, had the following intermediate beliefs:Attitude : “It’s terrible to fail. ”Rule: “Give up if a challenge seems too great. ”Assumptions : “If I try to do something difficult, I’ll fail. If I avoid doing it, I’ll be okay. ”These beliefs influence his view of a situation, which in turn influ -ences how he thinks, feels, and behaves. The relationship of these intermediate beliefs to core beliefs and automatic thoughts is depicted below:Core beliefsIntermediate beliefs (rules, attitudes, assumptions)Automatic thoughts How do core beliefs and intermediate beliefs arise? People try to make sense of their environment from their early developmental stages. They need to organize their experience in a coherent way in order to function adaptively (Rosen, 1988). Their interactions with the world and other people, influenced by their genetic predisposition, lead to certain understandings: their beliefs, which may vary in their accuracy and functionality. Of particular significance to the cognitive behavior therapist is that dysfunctional beliefs can be unlearned, and more real -ity-based and functional new beliefs can be developed and strength -ened through treatment. The quickest way to help patients feel better and behave more adaptively is to facilitate the direct modification of their core beliefs as soon as possible, because once they do so, patients will tend to interpret future situations or problems in a more constructive way. It is possible to undertake belief modification earlier in treatment with patients who have straightforward depression and who held reasonable and adaptive beliefs about themselves before the onset of their disorder. But when patients’ beliefs are entrenched, you can lose credibility and endanger 36 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND the therapeutic alliance if you question the validity of core beliefs too early. The usual course of treatment in cognitive behavior therapy, there -fore, involves an initial emphasis on identifying and modifying auto -matic thoughts that derive from the core beliefs (and on interventions that indirectly modify core beliefs). Therapists teach patients to iden -tify these cognitions that are closest to conscious awareness, and to gain distance from them by learning:Just because they believe something doesn’t necessarily mean it • is true. Changing their thinking so it is more reality based and useful • helps them feel better and progress toward their goals. It is easier for patients to recognize the distortion in their specific thoughts than in their broad understandings of themselves, their worlds, and others. But through repeated experiences in which they gain relief by working at a more superficial level of cognition, patients become more open to evaluating the beliefs that underlie their dysfunctional thinking. Relevant intermediate-level beliefs and core beliefs are evalu -ated in various ways and subsequently modified so that patients’ percep -tions of and conclusions about events change. This deeper modification of more fundamental beliefs makes patients less likely to relapse (Evans et al. , 1992; Hollon, De Rubeis, & Seligman, 1992). REl ATIONSHIP O f BEHAVIOR TO A UTO m ATIC T HOUGHTSThe hierarchy of cognition, as it has been explained to this point, can be illustrated as follows:Core beliefsIntermediate beliefs (rules, attitudes, assumptions)SituationAutomatic thoughtsReaction (emotional, behavioral, physiological) Cognitive Conceptualization 37 In a specific situation, one’s underlying beliefs influence one’s per -ception, which is expressed by situation-specific automatic thoughts. These thoughts, in turn, influence one’s emotional, behavioral, and physiological reaction. Figure 3. 2 illustrates the cognitive concep -tualization of Reader E in this particular situation, illustrating how his beliefs influence his thinking, which in turns influences his reac -tion. Note that had Reader E been able to evaluate his thinking, his emo -tions, physiology, and behavior may have been positively affected. For example, he may have responded to his thoughts by saying, “Wait a minute. This may be hard, but it’s not necessarily impossible. I’ve been able to understand this type of book before. If I keep at it, I’ll probably understand it better. ” Had he responded in such a way, he might have reduced his sadness and kept reading. To summarize, this reader felt discouraged because of his thoughts in a particular situation. Why did he have these thoughts when another reader did not? Unarticulated core beliefs about his incompetence influenced his perception of the situation. FIGURE 3. 2. Cognitive conceptualization of Reader E. Core belief: “I’m incompetent. ”Intermediate beliefs Attitude: “It’s terrible to fail. ”Rule: “I should give up if a challenge seems too great. ”Assumptions: “If I try to do something difficult, I’ll fail. If I avoid doing it, I’ll be okay. ”Situation: Reading a new textAutomatic thoughts: “This is just too hard. I’m so dumb. I’ll never master this. I’ll never make it as a therapist. ”Reaction:Emotional: Discouragement Physiological: Heaviness in body Behavioral: Avoids task and watches television instead . 38 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND A More Complex Cognitive Model It is important to note that the sequence of the perception of situations leading to automatic thoughts that then influence people’s reactions is an oversimplification at times. Thinking, mood, behavior, physiology, and the environment all can affect one another. Triggering situations can be:Discrete events (such as getting a low mark on a paper). • A stream of thoughts (such as thinking about doing schoolwork • or intrusive thoughts). A memory (such as getting a poor grade in the past). • An image (such as the disapproving face of a professor). • An emotion (such as noticing how intense one’s dysphoria is). • A behavior (such as staying in bed). • A physiological or mental experience (such as noticing one’s • rapid heartbeat or slowed-down thinking). There may be a complex sequence of events with many different trig -gering situations, automatic thoughts, and reactions, as pictured in Fig -ure 3. 3. As explained in the beginning of this chapter, it is essential for you to learn to conceptualize patients’ difficulties in cognitive terms in order to determine how to proceed in therapy—when to work on a specific problem or goal, automatic thought, belief, or behavior; what techniques to choose; and how to improve the therapeutic relationship. The basic questions to ask yourself are:“How did this patient end up here? ”“What vulnerabilities were significant? ”“How has the patient coped with her vulnerability? ”“Did certain life events (traumas, experiences, interactions) predispose her to her current difficulties? ”“What are the patient’s automatic thoughts, and what beliefs did they spring from? ”It is important to put yourself in your patients’ shoes, to develop empathy for what they are undergoing, to understand how they are feel -ing, and to perceive the world through their eyes. Given their history Cognitive Conceptualization 39 and set of beliefs, their perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and behavior should make sense. It is helpful to view therapy as a journey, and the conceptualization as the road map. You and the patient discuss the goals of therapy, the final destination. There are a number of ways to reach that destina -tion: for example, by main highways or back roads. Sometimes detours change the original plan. As you become more experienced and better at conceptualization, you fill in the relevant details in the map, and Situation: Sally feels exhausted (physiological trigger) when she wakes up . Automatic thought: “I’m too tired to get up. There’s no use in getting out of bed. I don’t have enough energy to go to class or study. ”Emotion: SadnessPhysiological response: Heaviness in body . Automatic thoughts: “What if [my chemistry professor] gives a pop quiz? What if he won’t let me take a makeup quiz? What if this counts against my grade? [image of a failing mark on her transcript]”Emotion: AnxietyPhysiological response: Heart starts to beat quickly . Situation: Notices rapid heartbeat . Automatic thought: “My heart’s beating so fast. What’s wrong with me? ”Emotion: Increased anxietyPhysiological response: Body feels tense, heart continues to beat rapidly . Automatic thought: “I’d better just stay in bed. ”Emotion: ReliefPhysiological response: Tension and heart rate reduce . Behavior: Stays in bed . Sally eventually gets up, arrives at class 20 minutes after it started, then has a host of automatic thoughts about being late and missing part of the lecture. FIGURE 3. 3. Complex cognitive model sequence. 40 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND your efficiency and effectiveness improve. At the beginning, however, it is reasonable to assume that you may not accomplish therapy in the most effective or efficient way. An accurate cognitive conceptualization aids you in determining what the main highways are and how best to travel. Conceptualization begins at the first contact with patients and is refined at every subsequent contact. You make hypotheses about patients, based not just on the cognitive formulation of the case, but also on the specific data patients present. You confirm, disconfirm, or modify your hypotheses as patients present new data. The conceptualization, there -fore, is fluid. At strategic points, you will directly check your hypotheses and formulation with patients. Generally, if the conceptualization is on target, patients confirm that it “feels right”—they agree that the picture the therapist presents truly resonates with them. Sally, for example, suffered from persistent sadness, anxiety, and loneliness. As part of her intake evaluation, I elicited a sampling of her automatic thoughts. I asked Sally when she generally was most dis -tressed—in which situations or times of day. Sally replied that she felt worst at bedtime, as she lay in bed, trying to fall asleep. Having ascer -tained that the previous night was a typical example, I asked the key question: “What was going through your mind last night, as you were lying in bed, trying to fall asleep? ” Sally replied, “I’ll never be able to finish my term paper. I’ll probably flunk out of here. I’ll never be able to make anything of myself. ” Sally also reported an image, an automatic thought in a pictorial form, which flashed through her mind. She saw herself, weighed down by a heavy backpack, trudging aimlessly down the street, looking quite downtrodden, directionless, and desperate. During the course of therapy, I rounded out my conceptualization. I organized my thinking through the use of a Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram (page 200) and a Cognitive Case Write-Up (Appendix A). Sally’s Core Beliefs As a child, Sally tried to make sense of herself, others, and her world. She learned through her own experiences, through interactions with others, through direct observation, and through others’ explicit and implicit messages to her. Her perceptions were also undoubtedly influ -enced by her genetic inheritance. Sally had a highly achieving older brother. As a young child, she perceived that she could not do anything as well as her brother and started to believe, although she did not put it into words, that she was incompetent and inferior. She kept comparing her performance to that of her brother and invariably came up lacking. She frequently had thoughts such as: “I can’t draw like Robert can. ” “He Cognitive Conceptualization 41 rides his bike better than I do. ” “I’ll never be as good a reader as he is. He does everything better than I do. ”Not all children with older siblings develop these kinds of dys -functional beliefs. But Sally’s ideas were reinforced by her mother, who frequently criticized her: “You did a terrible job straightening up your room. Can’t you do anything right? ” “Your brother got a good report card. But you? You’ll never amount to anything. ” Sally, like most chil -dren, placed enormous stock in her mother’s words, believing that her mother was correct about nearly everything. So when her mother criti -cized her, implying or directly stating that Sally was incompetent, Sally believed her. At school, Sally also compared herself to her peers. While she was an above-average student, she compared herself only to the best stu -dents, again coming up short. She had thoughts such as: “I’m not as good as they are. ” “I’ll never be able to understand all this as well as they can. ” So the idea that she was incompetent and inferior was rein -forced. Without recognizing that she was doing so, Sally often screened out or discounted positive information that contradicted these ideas. When she got a high mark on a test, she would tell herself, “The test was easy. ” When she learned ballet and became one of the better dancers in the group, she thought, “I’ll never be as good as my teacher. ” She usually made negative interpretations, thereby confirming her dysfunctional beliefs. For example, when her mother yelled at her for getting a B on a test, she thought, “Mom’s right. I am stupid. ” She consistently inter -preted negative events as demonstrating her shortcomings. In addition, when she experienced positive events such as winning an award, she often discounted them: “I was just lucky. It was a fluke. ”This process led to Sally’s developing a negative core belief about herself. Sally’s negative beliefs were not rock solid, however. Her father, although he traveled for business and was home only intermittently, was generally encouraging and supportive. When he taught her to hit a baseball, for example, he would praise her efforts. “That’s good . . . good swing . . . you’re getting it . . . keep going. ” Some of Sally’s teachers, too, praised her performance in school. Sally also had positive experi -ences with friends. She saw that if she tried hard, she could do some things better than her friends could—baseball, for example. So Sally also developed a counterbalancing positive belief that she was compe -tent in at least some ways. Sally’s core beliefs about her world and about other people were, for the most part, positive and functional. She generally believed that other people were well-intentioned, and she perceived her world as being relatively safe, stable, and predictable. 42 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Again, Sally’s core beliefs about herself, others, and her world were her most basic beliefs, which she had never really articulated until she entered treatment. As a teenager, her more positive core beliefs were dominant until she became depressed, and then her highly negative core beliefs became activated. Sally’s Attitudes, Rules, and Assumptions Somewhat more amenable to modification than her core beliefs were Sally’s intermediate beliefs. These attitudes, rules, and assumptions developed in the same way as core beliefs, as Sally tried to make sense of her world, of others, and of herself. Mostly through interactions with her family and significant others, she developed the following attitudes and rules:“I should be great at everything I try. ”“I should always do my best. ”“It’s terrible to waste your potential. ”As was the case with her core beliefs, Sally had not fully articulated these intermediate beliefs. But the beliefs nevertheless influenced her thinking and guided her behavior. In high school, for example, she did not try out for the school newspaper (although it interested her) because she assumed she could not write well enough. She felt both anxious before exams, thinking that she might not do well, and guilty, thinking that she should have studied more. When her more positive core beliefs predominated, however, she saw herself in a more positive light, although she never completely believed that she was competent. She developed the assumption “If I work hard, I can overcome my shortcomings and do well in school. ” When she became depressed, however, Sally did not really believe this assumption any longer and substituted the belief, “Because of my defi -ciencies, I’ll never amount to anything. ”Sally’s Coping Strategies The idea of being incompetent had always been quite painful to Sally, and she developed certain behavioral strategies to cope or compen -sate for what she saw as her shortcomings. As might be gleaned from her intermediate beliefs, Sally worked hard at school and at sports. She overprepared her assignments and studied quite hard for tests. She also became vigilant for signs of inadequacy and redoubled her efforts if she Cognitive Conceptualization 43 failed to master something at school. She rarely asked others for help for fear they would recognize her inadequacy. Sally’s Automatic Thoughts While Sally did not articulate these core beliefs and intermediate beliefs (until therapy), she was at least somewhat aware of her auto -matic thoughts in specific situations. In high school, for example (during which time she was not depressed), she tried out for the girls’ softball and hockey teams. She made the softball team and thought, “That’s great. I’ll get Dad to practice batting with me. ” When she failed to make the hockey team she was disappointed, but not particularly self-critical. In college, however, Sally became depressed during her freshman year. Later, when she considered playing an informal softball game with students in her dorm, her depression influenced her thinking: “I’m no good. I probably won’t even be able to hit the ball. ” Similarly, when she got a C on an English literature examination, she thought, “I’m so stu -pid. I’ll probably fail the course. I’ll never be able to make it through college. ”To summarize, in her nondepressed high school years, Sally’s more positive core beliefs were activated, and she had relatively more positive (and more realistic) thoughts. In her freshman year in college, however, her negative beliefs predominated during her depression, which led her to interpret situations quite negatively and to have predominantly negative (and unrealistic) thoughts. These distorted thoughts also led her to behave in self-defeating ways, which led to automatic thoughts about her behavior. Instead of interpreting her avoidance as a symp -tom of depression, she thought, “I’m a basket case, ” which then led to increased dysphoria and maladaptive behavior. Sequence Leading to Sally’s Depression How did Sally became depressed? Depression is caused by a variety of biopsychological and psychosocial factors. Sally may have had a genetic predisposition toward developing depressogenic beliefs. Not all nega -tive events, however, led her to feel dysphoric. She was able to get along until her innate vulnerability, influenced by the presence of negative beliefs, was challenged by a series of matching stressors (the “diathesis–stress” model; Beck, 1967). When Sally began college, she had several experiences that she interpreted in a highly negative fashion. One such experience occurred the first week. She had a conversation with other freshmen in her dorm who were relating the number of advanced placement courses and 44 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND exams they had taken that had exempted them from several basic fresh -man courses. Sally, who had no advanced placement credits, began to think how superior these students were to her. In her economics class, her professor outlined the course requirements and Sally immediately thought, “I won’t be able to do the research paper. ” She had difficulty understanding the first chapter in her chemistry text and she thought, “If I can’t even understand Chapter 1, how will I ever make it through the course? ”Sally’s beliefs made her vulnerable to interpreting events in a nega -tive way. She did not question her thoughts, but rather accepted them uncritically. As the weeks went on, Sally began to have more and more negative thoughts about herself and began to feel more and more dis -couraged and sad. She began to spend an inordinate amount of time studying, although she did not accomplish a great deal because of decreased concentration. She continued to be highly self-critical, and even had negative thoughts about her depressive symptoms: “What’s wrong with me? I shouldn’t feel this way. Why am I so down? I’m just hopeless. ” She withdrew somewhat from new friends at school and stopped calling her old friends for support. She discontinued running and swimming and other activities that had previously provided her with a sense of accomplishment. Thus she experienced a paucity of positive inputs. Eventually, her appetite decreased, her sleep became disturbed, and she became enervated and listless. Sally’s perception of and behavior in the circumstances at the time facilitated the expression of a biological and psychological vulnerability to depression. Conceptualizing a patient in cognitive terms is crucial to determin -ing the most efficient and effective course of treatment. It also aids in developing empathy, an ingredient that is critical in establishing a good working relationship with the patient. In general, the questions to ask when conceptualizing patients are:“How did the patient come to develop this disorder? ”“What were significant life events, experiences, and interactions? ”“What are the patient’s most basic beliefs about himself, his world, and others? ”“What are the patient’s assumptions, expectations, rules, and attitudes (intermediate beliefs)? ”“What strategies has the patient used throughout life to cope with these negative beliefs? ”“Which automatic thoughts, images, and behaviors help to maintain the disorder? ” Cognitive Conceptualization 45“How did the patient’s developing beliefs interact with life situations to make the patient vulnerable to the disorder? ”“What is happening in the patient’s life right now and what are the patient’s perceptions? ”Again, conceptualization begins at the first contact and is an ongo -ing process. You base your hypotheses on information you have col -lected from the patient, using the most parsimonious explanations and refraining from interpretations and inferences not clearly based on actual data. You will check out the conceptualization with patients at strategic points to ensure that it is accurate, as well as to help patients understand themselves and their difficulties. Your conceptualization is always subject to modification as you continually uncover new data that will lead you to confirm, refine, or discard your previous hypotheses. The ongoing process of conceptualization is emphasized throughout this book; Chapter 14 illustrates further how historical events shape patients’ understanding of themselves and their worlds. 46 Chapter 4 THE EVAl UATION SESSIONIn this chapter, you will learn about the goals and structure for this session. You will learn how to conduct the assessment, relate your ten-tative diagnosis, develop initial treatment goals, and shape the patient’s expectations for treatment. You will also learn what to do following the evaluation session, including devising a tentative cognitive conceptual-ization of the patient. Effective cognitive behavior therapy requires you to evaluate patients thoroughly, so you can accurately formulate the case, concep-tualize the individual patient, and plan treatment. While there is over-lap among treatments for various disorders, there are important varia-tions as well, based on the key cognitions and behavioral strategies of a particular disorder. Attention to the patient’s presenting problems, current functioning, symptoms, and history helps you develop an ini-tial conceptualization and formulate a general therapy plan. Even if a patient has been evaluated by a different clinician, you will need to supplement the evaluation with additional data collection. There are a number of tasks to accomplish in your fi rst contact with a patient, other than establishing the patient’s diagnosis. Assessment is not limited to this fi rst meeting with a patient, how-ever. You will continue to collect assessment data at each session to confi rm, change, or add to your diagnosis and conceptualization. It is possible to miss a diagnosis at intake if patients deliberately withhold information (some patients with substance abuse problems or ego-syn-tonic eating disorders may do this) or inadvertently fail to report impor-tant data. Or you might erroneously attribute certain symptoms (e. g. , The Evaluation Session 47 social isolation) to a particular disorder (depression), when another disorder is also present (social phobia). When another clinician has performed the evaluation, you will undoubtedly need to collect addi -tional information pertinent to the use of cognitive behavior therapy as the treatment modality. GOA l S Of THE A SSESS m ENT S ESSIONIn addition to correctly diagnosing patients, the assessment helps you:formulate the case and create an initial cognitive conceptualization • of the patient. Determine whether you will be an appropriate therapist. • Determine whether you can provide the appropriate “dose” of • therapy (e. g. , if you are able to provide only weekly therapy but the patient requires a day program). Determine whether adjunctive treatment or services (such as • medication) may be indicated. Initiate a therapeutic alliance with the patient (and with family • members, if relevant). Begin to socialize the patient into the structure and process of • therapy. Identify important problems and set broad goals. • It is desirable to collect as much information as possible before you see the patient for the first time. Request that patients send, or arrange to have sent, relevant reports from current and previous clinicians, including both mental health and health professionals. The evaluation session itself will require less time if patients are able to fill out ques -tionnaires and self-report forms beforehand. It is especially important that patients have had a recent medical checkup. Occasionally patients suffer from organic problems, not psychological ones. For example, hypothyroidism can be mistaken for depression. Inform the patient during the initial phone call that it is often use -ful to have a family member, partner, or trusted friend accompany the patient to session to provide additional information and/or to learn how he or she can be helpful to the patient. Make sure patients under -stand that the evaluation will help you determine whether they are good candidates for cognitive behavior therapy and whether you believe you will be able to provide the needed treatment. 48 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND STRUCTURE O f THE A SSESS m ENT S ESSIONIn this session, you will:Greet the patient. • Collaboratively decide with the patient whether a family • member should attend all, part, or none of the session. Set the agenda and convey appropriate expectations • for the session. Conduct the assessment. • Set initial broad goals. • Elicit feedback from the patient. • STARTING THE E VAl UATION S ESSIONBefore patients enter your office, review whatever records they have brought and the forms they have completed. It is usually desirable to meet with patients alone at first. Then you can discuss whether an accompanying family member (if there is one) should attend the ses -sion. It is often helpful to bring this person in at least toward the end of the session, as you convey your initial impressions, including tentative diagnosis, and review broad therapy goals. You can ask for the family member’s perspective on the patient’s problems and, if advisable, set the scene for the family member to return at some point to learn what he or she can do to be more helpful to the patient. Next, let the patient know what to expect from this initial appoint -ment. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, as I explained on the phone, this is our evaluation session. It’s not a therapy session, so we won’t work on solving your problems today. We’ll start doing that next time. Today, I need to ask you a lot of questions [providing a rationale] so I can determine your diagnosis. Some of the questions will be relevant. A number won’t be, but I need to ask them so I can rule in the problems you do have and rule out the problems you don’t have. Is that okay? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: I will probably need to interrupt you sometimes today, so I can get the information I need. If it bothers you, would you let me know? The Evaluation Session 49 pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: Before we begin, I’d like to tell you what I expect to cover today. [setting the agenda] I’d like to find out a lot about symptoms you’ve been experiencing and how you’ve been functioning lately, and also about your history. Then I’ll ask you to tell me anything else you think I should know. Then we’ll set some broad goals for treatment. I’ll tell you what my initial impressions are and what I think we should focus on in treatment. I’ll ask you how that sounds. And at the end, I’ll see whether you have any other questions or concerns. [being collaborative] Does that sound okay? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Anything else you want to cover today? pa Ti e n T: I was hoping you could help me figure out what to do about school. I’m so far behind. Th e r a p i s T: (making a note ) Let me write that down. I don’t know whether there will be time today, but we can definitely get to it next time, at our first treatment session. THE A SSESS m ENT P HASEYou will need to know about many areas of the patient’s current and past experience to develop a sound treatment plan (across sessions), plan treatment within sessions, develop a good therapeutic relation -ship, guide the patient in setting goals, and generally carry out effective treatment. These areas include:Patient demographics. • Chief complaints and current problems. • History of present illness and precipitating events. • Coping strategies (adaptive and maladaptive), current and • historical. Psychiatric history, including kinds of psychosocial treatments • (and perceived helpfulness of these treatments), hospitalizations, medication, suicide attempts, and current status. Substance use history and current status. • medical history and current status. • family psychiatric history and current status. • Developmental history. • 50 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND General family history and current status. • Social history and current status. • Educational history and current status. • Vocational history and current status. • Religious/spiritual history and current status. • Strengths, values, and adaptive coping strategies. • While a detailed account of assessment procedures and instruments are beyond the scope of this book, many sources can help, including Ant -ony and Barlow (2010); Dobson and Dobson (2009); Kuyken and col -leagues (2009); Lazarus and Lazarus (1991); Ledley, Marx, and Heim -berg (2005). It is also critical to determine the degree to which patients might be suicidal. Wenzel, Brown, and Beck (2008) provide assessment and practice guidelines for suicidal patients. Another important part of the evaluation is asking how patients spend their time. Asking patients to describe their typical day gives you additional insight into their daily experience and facilitates setting spe -cific goals at the first treatment session. As they describe a typical day, look for:Variations in their mood. • Whether and how they interact with family, friends, • and people at work. How they are generally functioning at home, work, • and elsewhere. How they spend their free time. • You will also probe for what they are not doing and what they are actively avoiding. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, I’d like to get an idea of what your daily routine is like. Can you tell me what you do from the time you wake up in the morning until the time you go to sleep at night? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: What time do you wake up? pa Ti e n T: (Sighs . ) Well, I usually wake up around 5 o’clock. Th e r a p i s T: Then what do you do? The Evaluation Session 51 pa Ti e n T: Usually I toss and turn for a couple of hours at least. Th e r a p i s T: What time do you get out of bed for the day? pa Ti e n T: It depends. I usually stay in bed until the last minute. I have class at 9 o’clock 3 days a week, so I get up at 8:30, 8:40, something like that. Th e r a p i s T: And on the other days? pa Ti e n T: I don’t have to get up that early. So I usually stay in bed till I get hungry for breakfast. Th e r a p i s T: So you have breakfast at . . . ? pa Ti e n T: Sometimes 10 o’clock. Sometimes noon. Th e r a p i s T: Is that a change from last semester? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, I used to get up by 9 at the latest. Th e r a p i s T: What do you do after breakfast? pa Ti e n T: I usually hang out in my dorm room. Watch television. Maybe try to do some reading for class. But I usually can’t concentrate. So I stop doing it. Sometimes I fall asleep. Th e r a p i s T: What else do you do in the afternoon? pa Ti e n T: Most days I have class from 1 to 4. Th e r a p i s T: Do you go? Have you missed any classes? pa Ti e n T: No, I go. But it’s really hard to sit there. Sometimes I just space out. Th e r a p i s T: What do you do after class? pa Ti e n T: Go back to my room. Th e r a p i s T: And then what? pa Ti e n T: It depends. Th e r a p i s T: What do you sometimes do? pa Ti e n T: Usually I try to study a little. But sometimes I end up surfing the Web or falling asleep or watching TV. Th e r a p i s T: What do you do for dinner? pa Ti e n T: I go to the cafeteria with someone from my dorm. Th e r a p i s T: What do you do after that? pa Ti e n T: It depends. Usually go back to my room. I try to do some work. Sometimes I can and sometimes I can’t. I try for a little while and then I mostly watch TV. Th e r a p i s T: And then? pa Ti e n T: I get in bed around 11, 11:30. 52 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Do you fall asleep right away? pa Ti e n T: Not usually. It takes me about an hour. Th e r a p i s T: And then you sleep through until 5? pa Ti e n T: Yes. This description helps me pinpoint difficulties we will probably need to address: difficulty sleeping, napping, irregular schedule, social isola -tion, limited opportunities for mastery (a sense of accomplishment), trouble concentrating, falling behind in schoolwork, too much TV watching. Because Sally, like most depressed patients, has focused on the problems she encounters, I also ask her about positive experiences and adaptive coping strategies. (“Sally, what are the better parts of the day for you? ”; “It sounds like you were pretty tired. How did you get yourself to go to class? ”)Collecting data in this way guides my thinking in developing an initial treatment plan. I’ll also use the information in the first session when we set goals for treatment and do activity scheduling. In addition, I will ask Sally for a description of what she does on a typical weekend, when she doesn’t have the structure of attending classes. Throughout the assessment phase, you will be alert for indications that the patient is unsure about committing to treatment. For example, as Sally describes her current symptoms, she expresses hopeless think -ing. I use her automatic thought to subtly relate the cognitive model, indicate how it will be a target of treatment in the future, and ensure that our tentative alliance hasn’t suffered. pa Ti e n T: It feels like I’ve got so many problems. I don’t think anything can help. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, that’s an interesting thought: “I don’t think anything can help. ” How does that thought make you feel? Sad? Hopeless? pa Ti e n T: Both. Th e r a p i s T: This is exactly the kind of depressed thought that we’ll be talking about starting next week. We’ll need to find out whether that thought is 100% true, 0% true, or someplace in the middle. Meanwhile, is there anything I said or did that makes you think I can’t help, or this kind of treatment can’t help? It is important to structure the patient’s responses to collect the data you need. Providing a guideline can help:Th e r a p i s T: For the next few questions, I just need you to [answer “yes, ” “no, ” or “I’m not sure”] or [answer in one or two sentences]. The Evaluation Session 53 When patients start to provide unneeded details or go off on a tangent, it is important to gently interrupt:Th e r a p i s T: Sorry to interrupt, but I need to know . . . f INA l PART O f THE A SSESS m ENTToward the end of the assessment, it is useful to ask patients whether there is anything else that is important for you to know. An important follow-up question is: “Is there anything you’re reluctant to tell me? You don’t have to tell me what it is. I just need to know whether there’s more to tell, maybe at some point in the future. ”INVO l VING A f A m Il Y m E m BERIf family members have accompanied patients to the office, you might now ask patients whether they would like to invite them into the session (unless, of course, they have been there from the beginning). Make sure there is nothing the patient wants you to refrain from saying to the family member. Elicit the patient’s permission to:Inquire what the family member thinks is most important for • you to know; if he or she focuses only on the negative, ask about the patients’ positive qualities, strengths, and coping strategies. Go over your initial impressions. • Present your tentative treatment plan. • REl ATING Y OUR Im PRESSIONSExplain to patients that you will need time to review your notes, their forms, and previous reports to establish their diagnosis. For most cases of depression and anxiety, it is appropriate to give your initial impres -sions of their diagnosis and show them how you will confirm the diagno -sis by using the DSM, a diagnostic manual listing psychiatric disorders and their symptoms. It may or may not help, at this initial encounter, to tell patients they have a severe mental illness or personality disorder. Instead, it may be more prudent to summarize the problems and symp -toms the patient is experiencing. 54 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND SETTING I NITIA l GOA l S f OR T REAT m ENT AND R El ATING Y OUR T REAT m ENT Pl ANSetting goals and relating a treatment plan help provide patients with hope. Th e r a p i s T: If it’s okay, I’d like to spend a few minutes talking about your goals for treatment, and how I think treatment will go. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: (Writes “Goals” at the top of a sheet of paper . ) Goals are really just the flip side of problems. We’ll set more specific goals next ses -sion, but very broadly, should we say: Reduce depression? Reduce anxiety? Do better at school? Get back to socializing? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: (Jots these down . ) Now I’d like to tell you how I think you’re going to get better and then I want to hear how it sounds to you. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: Starting next week, we’re going to work toward your goals. At every session, I’ll ask you what problems you want my help in solving. For example, next week you might say, “I’m still having trouble getting my schoolwork done, ” which relates to your goal of doing better at school. Then we’ll do some problem solving. We might figure out ways to improve your concentration, to get your -self on a study schedule, and to get help from other people if you need it. ( pause ) Does that sound okay? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: And we’ll also look for depressed thinking that might get in the way. For example, earlier in the session you said, “I’m such a failure, ” and you told me how depressed you feel when you have thoughts like that. Do you see how that idea can sap your motiva -tion to study? How it can make you feel terrible? How you might then curl up in bed instead of going to the library? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, that’s what happens. Th e r a p i s T: So one thing we’ll do together is evaluate thoughts like that. What’s the evidence you’re a failure? Any evidence that you’re not a failure? Is there another way of looking at this situation, for example, that you’re depressed and need some help in problem solving, but that doesn’t mean you’re a failure? pa Ti e n T: Hmm. Th e r a p i s T: So we’ll help you change your depressed and anxious thinking to make it more realistic, and we’ll come up with solu - The Evaluation Session 55 tions to your problems that you can try out during the rest of the week. And you’ll learn skills that you can use for the rest of your life, so you can continue solving your problems and think more realistically, and act in ways that can get you to your goals. [eliciting feedback] How does that sound? pa Ti e n T: It makes sense. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, that’s how we find people get better, by making small changes in their thinking and behavior every day. [eliciting feed -back] Now, was there anything I said that didn’t sound good? pa Ti e n T: [expressing another automatic thought] I just don’t know if it will work. Th e r a p i s T: Well, I don’t have a crystal ball, so I can’t give you a 100% guarantee. But there’s nothing you’ve told me that makes me think it won’t work. ( pause . ) Are you willing to give it a try? Do you want to come back next week? pa Ti e n T: Yes, I do. Q: What if . . . patients express concern about the treatment plan? A: First, positively reinforce them for expressing their skepticism or misgivings (“It’s good you told me that”). Next, you will need to collect more data by asking, “What makes you think this treatment won’t work? ” and “What do you think would help more? ” Based on the patient’s answers, you will conceptualize the problem in cognitive terms and plan a strategy. For example, when patients believe your treatment won’t help because past treatments have been ineffective, you can ask whether they felt they had a good therapeutic alliance with their previous therapists and whether, at every session, their therapists:Set agendas. • Figured out with them what they could do to have a better • week. Wrote down what patients wanted to remember to say to them - • selves when they had depressed thinking. Taught them specifically how to evaluate their thinking and • change their behavior. Asked for feedback to make sure therapy was on the right • track. Most patients have not experienced this kind of treatment, and you can say, “I’m glad to hear that, because it sounds as if our treatment here will be different. If it were exactly the same as your past experiences, I’d be less hopeful. ” 56 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Q: What if . . . patients reply that a previous therapist has engaged in all the above activities at every session? A: In this case, you will need to spend more time finding out precisely what occurred, especially whether the therapist provided treat -ment individualized for the patient and his specific disorder(s), based on the latest research and practice guidelines. In any case, you can encourage the patient to give your treatment a try for a few sessions and indicate that you will then jointly review whether the treatment seems to be working. Ex PECTATIONS f OR T REAT m ENTAt this session, you will give patients a general sense of how long they should expect treatment to take. Usually it is best to suggest a range, 2–4 months for many patients with straightforward major depression, although some might be able to terminate sooner (or might have to, due to financial constraints or insurance limitations). Other patients, par -ticularly those with chronic psychiatric disorders, or those who want to work on problems related to a personality disorder, may remain in treat -ment for a year or more. And patients with severe mental illness may need more intensive treatment when they are more highly symptomatic, and periodic booster sessions for a very long time (along with medication). Most patients progress satisfactorily with weekly sessions unless they are severely depressed or anxious, suicidal, or clearly in need of more support. Toward the end of treatment, you may gradually space sessions further apart to give patients more opportunities to solve prob -lems, make decisions, and use their therapy tools independently. In the following transcript, I give Sally an idea of how I expect therapy will proceed. Th e r a p i s T: If it’s okay with you, Sally, we’ll plan to meet once a week until you’re feeling significantly better, then we’ll move to once every 2 weeks, then maybe once every 3 or 4 weeks. We’ll decide how to space out therapy together. Even when we decide to end, I’ll recommend that you come back for a “booster” session once every few months for a while. How does that sound? pa Ti e n T: Fine. Th e r a p i s T: It’s hard to predict now how long you should be in therapy. My best guess is somewhere around 8 to 14 sessions. If we find that you have some long-standing problems that you want to work on, it could take longer. Again, we’ll decide together what seems to be best. Okay? The Evaluation Session 57 Between the Evaluation and First Therapy Session Before the first therapy session, you will write up your evaluation report and initial treatment plan. If you have obtained consent, you will con -tact the patient’s previous mental health and health professionals to request reports, ask questions, and obtain additional information. You will also contact relevant current professionals to discuss your findings and coordinate care. Conversations by phone can reveal important information that had not been documented in writing. You will also start to devise a tentative cognitive conceptualization. DEVISING AN I NITIA l COGNITIVE C ONCEPTUA l Iz ATION AND T REAT m ENT Pl ANYou will synthesize the information you gleaned from the evaluation to develop an initial cognitive conceptualization, informed by the cogni -tive formulation (the basic beliefs and behavioral patterns) associated with the patient’s diagnosis. You will hypothesize about the develop -ment of the patient’s disorder. “Were there important early life events that led to the development of negative core beliefs? ”“What are the patient’s core beliefs? ”“What precipitated the disorder? ”“Did the patient put an adverse construction on certain precipitating events? ”“How do the patient’s thinking and behavior contribute to the maintenance of the disorder? ”You will then use the conceptualization to develop a broad treatment plan. Pulling together what I had learned from the evaluation, I hypoth -esized that Sally was vulnerable to seeing herself as incompetent (a belief that developed as a result of interactions with her parents, sibling, and some teachers). When she entered college, Sally began to perceive herself as unable to meet the new demands of school and independent living. She began to develop a generalized sense of incompetence; that is, a core belief of incompetence became activated. She began to have many automatic thoughts across situations about the likelihood that she would fail. These thoughts led her to feel sad, anxious, and hope -less. She was affected behaviorally, as well. She began to give up, spend - 58 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND ing too much time alone in her room. She failed to persist in doing assignments she viewed as difficult, and she began to fall behind in her schoolwork. She saw her difficulties as an innate flaw, and not as the result of depression. A paucity of pleasure and mastery activities increased her dysphoria (see Appendix A). Understanding the cognitive model of depression and being famil -iar with the major treatment strategies for depression, I developed a more specific treatment plan than the simplified one I had presented to Sally. I hypothesized that I would initially need to focus on the fol -lowing: helping her solve academic and daily living problems; encour -aging her to become much more active; and teaching her to identify, evaluate, and modify her inaccurate or unhelpful negative thinking, especially thoughts associated with failure and incompetence (since she had expressed those ideas). I hypothesized that we would work more directly on her core belief of incompetence toward the middle of treatment, but I did not yet know whether it would be important to include a focus on the historic antecedents to her belief. I also did not know at this point whether Sally had dysfunctional beliefs associated with unlovability or worthlessness (see Chapter 14) that we would have to modify; she had not provided data to support the existence of these beliefs at the evaluation. I planned to emphasize relapse prevention in the final part of treatment. I continued to refine this basic treatment plan throughout therapy as I got to know Sally and the nature of her difficulties better. 59 Chapter 5 STRUCTURE Of THE f IRST THERAPY SESSIONIn this chapter, you will learn how to structure the initial session, including how to:Discuss the patient’s diagnosis. • Do a mood check. • Set goals. • Start working on a problem. • Set homework. • Elicit feedback. • Most patients feel comfortable when you tell them how and why you would like to structure sessions. Doing so demystifi es the process of therapy and keeps treatment on track. Chapter 6 focuses on an essen-tial component for depressed patients: initiating behavioral activation. Chapter 7 describes the common structure for subsequent sessions, and Chapter 8 discusses problems in structuring sessions. GOAl S AND STRUCTURE Of THE INITIAl SESSIONBefore the fi rst session, you will review the patient’s intake evaluation and you will keep your initial conceptualization and treatment plan 60 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND in mind as you conduct the session, being prepared to change course if need be. Most standard cognitive behavior therapy sessions last for about 45–50 minutes, but the first one often takes an hour. Your goals for the first session are to:Establish rapport and trust with patients, normalize their • difficulties, and instill hope. Socialize patients into treatment by educating them about their • disorder(s), the cognitive model, and the process of therapy. Collect additional data to help you conceptualize the patient. • Develop a goal list. • Start solving a problem important to the patient (and/or get the • patient behaviorally activated). To accomplish these goals, you will use the following format: Initial Part of Session 1 1. Set the agenda (and provide a rationale for doing so). 2. Do a mood check. 3. Obtain an update (since the evaluation). 4. Discuss the patient’s diagnosis and do psychoeducation. Middle Part of Session 1 5. Identify problems and set goals. 6. Educate the patient about the cognitive model. 7. Discuss a problem. End of Session 1 8. Provide or elicit a summary. 9. Review homework assignment. 10. Elicit feedback. SETTING THE A GENDAAs this is the first session, you will begin by greeting the patient and set -ting the agenda. Doing so frequently reduces patients’ anxieties, as they quickly find out what to expect. You will provide a rationale and make sure the patient agrees with the topics you propose. (In future sessions, Structure of the First Therapy Session 61 you will set the agenda sometime in the initial part of the session, but not necessarily at the very beginning. )Th e r a p i s T: Sally, I’m glad you came in today. Is it all right if we start off by deciding what we’re going to talk about today? It’s what we call “setting the agenda. ” We’ll do this at the beginning of every ses -sion [providing a rationale] so we make sure we have time to cover what’s most important to you. I have a list of things I’d like to go over today, and then [being collaborative] I’ll ask you what you’d like to add. Is that okay? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Our first session will be a little different from future ses -sions, because we have a lot of ground to cover and we need to get to know each other better. Here’s what I’d like to go over. First, in a couple of minutes [alerting Sally that I don’t want to dive into a topic before setting a complete agenda], I’d like to check on how you’ve been feeling, find out what’s happened since the evaluation, and talk a little about your diagnosis. ( pause ) Then I’d like to set some more specific goals. Does that sound okay? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Along the way, we might figure out some things for you to do before we meet again, [behavioral activation] especially making some changes in your schedule. And at the end, I’ll ask you what you thought about the session. [eliciting feedback] How does that sound? pa Ti e n T: Fine. Th e r a p i s T: Is there anything you want to add to the agenda today? pa Ti e n T: Well, I know I should be doing more. But I’m so tired. It’s just so hard to concentrate on my work and go out with friends. I end up spending a lot of time sleeping or watching TV and . . . Th e r a p i s T: (gently interrupting ) Is it okay if I interrupt you for a moment? How about if I put “doing more things” on our agenda, and we’ll try to get to it today? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: (jotting down this agenda item ) You’ll notice that I tend to write down a lot of things during our session. [providing a ratio -nale] I want to make sure to remember what’s important . . . Okay, anything else even more important for the agenda today? pa Ti e n T: No, I don’t think so. Th e r a p i s T: If you think of other important things as we go along, just let me know. 62 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Ideally, setting the agenda is quick and to the point. Explaining the rationale for why you want to set an agenda makes the process of ther -apy more understandable to patients and elicits their active participa -tion in a structured, productive way. Q: What if . . . patients express a strong preference to spend therapy time in another way? A: Patients occasionally, though infrequently , balk at the agenda you present for this first session. This might happen for several rea -sons. You may have presented the agenda in too controlling a fashion, without being collaborative. There may be pressing issues on their mind for which they desperately want immediate help in the session. They might prefer to spend the session talking freely about whatever comes in their mind, without structure or inter -ruption. What do you do? Above all, you need to engage patients so they will return to treatment for the next session. If you judge that trying to persuade patients to adhere to your agenda will endan -ger their engagement, especially in this first session, you might offer to split the therapy time. If they demur, you can spend the session doing what they want. At the next session, you will find out whether doing so helped alleviate their suffering significantly during the week. If not, they may be more motivated to spend at least part of the session discussing what you think is important to help them feel better. DOING A m OOD C HEC k Having set the agenda, you will next do a brief mood check. In addition to asking Sally for a brief narrative report of her mood since I saw her last, I quickly review the symptom checklists she filled out just prior to the session (see Appendix B for information about the Beck Depres -sion Inventory, Anxiety Inventory, and Hopelessness Scale). Because I initially just want a brief overview of her mood, I cue her to provide me with an answer in just a few words. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, next. Can we start with how you’ve been doing this week? I’d like to see the forms you filled out. While I look them over, [providing a guideline] can you tell me in a sentence or two how you felt for most of the week? pa Ti e n T: I’ve been really depressed the whole time. Structure of the First Therapy Session 63 Th e r a p i s T: (looking over the forms ) It looks as if you’ve been feeling pretty anxious, too, is that right? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: [being collaborative] If it’s okay with you, I’d like you to come to every session a few minutes early so you can fill out these three forms. [providing a rationale] They help give me a quick idea of how you’ve been feeling in the past week, although I’ll always want you to describe how you’ve been doing in your own words, too. pa Ti e n T: Okay. In this first session, as in every session, I note the summed scores of the objective tests, comparing them to the scores from the evaluation. I also quickly scan individual items to determine whether the tests point out anything of particular importance. I especially note items related to hopelessness and suicidality on the Beck Depression Inventory–II. If these items are elevated, I will do a risk assessment (Wenzel et al. , 2008) to determine whether we need to spend the next part of the session developing a plan to keep the patient safe. Q: What if . . . patients cannot or will not fill out objective tests? A: If you do not have access to symptom checklists, if they are inap -propriate for patients (e. g. , patients aren’t sufficiently literate), or if they express reluctance about completing them, you can teach them, at this initial session or at the next session, to rate their mood on a 0–10 scale: “Can you think back over the past week? If 0 means not depressed at all, and 10 means the most depressed you’ve ever been, what has your depression been like for most of the week? ” Or you can ask patients, “Can you tell me about your depression this week? Would you say it was mild, moderate, or severe? How did your mood compare to other weeks? ” Other problems related to doing a mood check are discussed in Chap -ter 8. OBTAINING AN U PDATEIn the next part of the session, you will question patients to discover whether there are any important problems or issues that they have not yet mentioned that might take priority in the session. Then you will probe for positive experiences the patient had during the week. 64 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Next, what happened between the evaluation and now that’s important for me to know? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks . ) Well, my parents have been putting pressure on me to figure out what I’m going to do this summer. Th e r a p i s T: [collecting data about the problem to establish whether it’s of immediate importance and of high priority] Has this been really upsetting to you? pa Ti e n T: (Sighs . ) Not that much. It’s just one more thing. Th e r a p i s T: Is this something you want my help with? pa Ti e n T: Yes, I guess so. Th e r a p i s T: We don’t have a lot of time today. Do you think we could postpone talking about it until another time? pa Ti e n T: That’s okay. Th e r a p i s T: I’ll put it at the bottom of my notes, and ask you next week how high a priority it is for you. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: Was there anything else that was really important this week? pa Ti e n T: No, I guess not. It was pretty much the same as last week. By asking these questions, I find out that there is not an important problem that needs to take priority over what is already on the agenda, so I can move ahead. How do you decide which problems are pressing and which are not? You will establish how distressed the patient is by the problem and whether the patient really needs to solve it immediately (e. g. , not solv -ing it could put the patient or others in harm’s way, or endanger the patient’s livelihood or living situation). Discussion of most problems, especially chronic ones (such as difficulty functioning at home or argu -ments with family members), can usually be postponed to a future ses -sion so you can cover what you need to in this initial session. Q: What if . . . there had been a pressing agenda item? A: There are several reasons for deviating from the usual structure in the first session. 1. If patients are at risk or they are putting others at risk. 2. If patients are so distressed by a problem that they cannot focus on the topics that you want to cover. 3. If you assess that patients will be so upset by not discuss - Structure of the First Therapy Session 65 ing the problem that the therapeutic relationship could be impaired, and/or that the patient is likely not to come back for another session. When you ask patients for an update early in treatment, they invari -ably report only negative experiences. You then ask, “What positive things happened this week? ” or “When were some times that you felt even a little bit better this week? ” These questions help patients see real -ity more clearly, as the depression has undoubtedly led them to focus almost exclusively on the negative. DISCUSSING THE D IAGNOSISIn the next part of the session, you will briefly review patients’ present -ing problems and ask them to bring you up to date:Th e r a p i s T: Sally, I’d like to discuss what I found out in the evaluation session last week. Is it okay if we talk for a few moments about your diagnosis? Most patients want to know their general diagnosis, and to establish that you don’t think they are strange or abnormal. Usually it is prefer -able to avoid the label of a personality disorder diagnosis. Instead it is better to say something more general and jargon free, such as, “It looks as if you’ve been pretty depressed for the last year and you’ve had some long-standing problems with relationships and with work. ” It’s also desirable to give patients some initial information about their condition so they can start attributing some of their problems to their disorder instead of to their character (“There’s something wrong with me. I’m just no good. ”) The following transcript illustrates how to edu -cate patients who are depressed. Th e r a p i s T: The evaluation shows that you have a moderate depres -sion. I want you to know that it’s a real illness. It’s not the same as people saying, “Oh, I’m so depressed” when they’re feeling down. You have a real depression. pa Ti e n T: (Sighs . )Th e r a p i s T: I know that because you have the symptoms in this diag -nostic manual ( showing Sally the DSM ). For each mental health dis -order, this manual lists the symptoms, just as a neurology diagnos -tic manual would list the symptoms of a migraine. 66 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: Oh, I didn’t know that. Th e r a p i s T: [providing hope] Fortunately, cognitive behavior therapy is very effective in helping people overcome depression. pa Ti e n T: I was afraid you’d think I was crazy. Th e r a p i s T: Not at all. [normalizing] You have a fairly common condi -tion, and it sounds as though you have a lot of the same problems as most of our patients here. But that’s typical of how people with depression think. How do you feel now that you’ve found out I don’t think you’re crazy? pa Ti e n T: (Sighs . ) Relieved. Th e r a p i s T: That’s a lot of what we’ll be doing in treatment. Identifying your depressed thinking and helping you see things more realisti -cally. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: [anticipating that Sally might blame herself for thinking in an unrealistic way] Now, it’s not your fault that you have this kind of negative thinking. It’s a primary symptom of depression. For every -one with depression, it’s as if they’re seeing themselves and their worlds and the future [the “cognitive triad” of depression] through eyeglasses covered with black paint. ( I pantomime painting an imagi -nary pair of glasses on my face . ) These dark glasses make everything look dark and hopeless. Part of what we’ll do in therapy is to scrape off the black paint ( pantomiming ) so you can see things more real -istically . . . Is that clear? [Using an analogy often helps the patient to see her situation in a different way. ]pa Ti e n T: Yeah. I understand. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, let’s go over some of the other symptoms of depres -sion that you have. I see from the evaluation that the depression is interfering with your sleep and your energy. It sounds as if it’s also affecting your motivation to do things. [normalizing] Now, most depressed people start criticizing themselves for not being the same as they had been before. [eliciting specific incidents] Do you remember any recent times you’ve criticized yourself? pa Ti e n T: (Sighs . ) Yeah. Lately I’ve been getting out of bed late and not getting my work done, and I think I’m lazy and no good. Th e r a p i s T: Now, if you had pneumonia, and had trouble getting out of bed and getting everything done, would you call yourself lazy and no good? pa Ti e n T: No, I guess not. Th e r a p i s T: Would it help this week if you answered back the thought, “I’m lazy and no good”? Structure of the First Therapy Session 67 pa Ti e n T: Probably. Th e r a p i s T: What could you remind yourself? [Eliciting a response rather than just providing one fosters active participation and a degree of autonomy. ]pa Ti e n T: I guess that I am depressed, and it’s harder for me to do things. Th e r a p i s T: Good. It’s going to be really important for you to remem -ber that this week. Would you like me to write it down? Or would you like to? pa Ti e n T: You can. Th e r a p i s T: (pulling out a piece of carbonless paper [see Figure 5. 1] ) Okay, I’ll date this paper at the top. Now what should we call this: your therapy homework? Your action plan? pa Ti e n T: Homework, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: Good. ( Writes “Homework” at the top . ) The first item is to read something about what we just discussed. I’ll write down, “If I start thinking I’m lazy and no good, remind myself that I have a real ill -ness, called depression, that makes it harder for me to do things. ” (pausing and anticipating that this statement could lead to hopelessness ) Is it okay if I write down another reminder? “As the treatment starts to work, my depression will lift, and things will get easier. ”Jan. 22 Homework:Read this list twice a day; set an alarm to remember. 1. If I start thinking I’m lazy and no good, remind myself that I have a real illness, called depression, that makes it harder for me to do things. As the treatment starts to work, my depression will lift, and things will get easier. 2. Read goal list and add others, if I think of any. 3. When I notice my mood getting worse, ask myself, “What’s going through my mind right now? ” and jot down the thoughts. Remind myself that just because I think something, doesn’t necessarily mean it’s true. 4. m ake plans with Allison and Joe. Remember, if they say no, it’s likely that they’d like to hang out with me but they’re too busy. 5. Read Coping with Depression booklet (optional). FIGURE 5. 1. Sally’s first-session homework list. 68 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Q: What if . . . the patient negates the analogy? A: Some patients say, “Yes, but pneumonia is a biological disease. ” A good reply to this includes the specific depressive symptoms the patient has been experiencing: “Depression is biological , too; it’s a real disease with real symptoms. Now, just feeling sad or down is not an illness. But that’s not just what you’ve been experiencing. You’ve been feeling sad and down and hopeless; you’ve been self-critical, hardly anything interests you any more, you’ve been with -drawing from activities; your sleep and energy have been affected. That’s how I know you have a real illness, every bit as real as pneu -monia. ”Many patients benefit from another homework assignment: Read -ing a specific chapter in a cognitive behavior therapy book on depres -sion for consumers (see www. academyofct. org ), or a booklet such as Cop-ing with Depression (see www. beckinstitute. org ), will reinforce important ideas from this session. Ask patients to make mental or written notes about what they agree with, disagree with, or have questions about. PROB l Em IDENTI f ICATION AND GOA l SETTINGNext you will focus on identifying specific problems. As a logical exten -sion, you will help patients turn these problems into goals to work on in treatment. Th e r a p i s T: Now, let’s review the problems you’ve been having. pa Ti e n T: (Sighs . ) Oh, I don’t know. Everything is such a mess. I’m doing terribly at school. I’m way behind. I feel so tired and down all the time. I feel sometimes like I should just give up. Th e r a p i s T: (questioning to make sure Sally is not actively suicidal ) Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself? pa Ti e n T: No, not really. I just wish all my problems would somehow go away. Th e r a p i s T: (empathically ) It sounds like you’re feeling overwhelmed? pa Ti e n T: Yes, I don’t know what to do. Th e r a p i s T: [helping Sally to focus and to break down her problems into a more manageable size] Okay, it sounds like you have two major problems right now. One is that you’re not doing well at school. The other is that you feel really tired and down. Are there any others? Structure of the First Therapy Session 69 pa Ti e n T: Well, like I told you last week, I know I’m alone in my room too much. I should be spending more time with my friends. Th e r a p i s T: [getting Sally to participate more actively in the goal-set -ting process] Okay, let’s turn these problems into goals. Would you like to write them down, or should I? pa Ti e n T: You can. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. ( writing as they go along ) Now, the first thing you mentioned was improving your schoolwork. Then you mentioned decreasing your worry about tests and grades and spending more time with friends. Good. Now what other goals do you have? How would you like to be different? Or how would you like your life to be different as a result of treatment? pa Ti e n T: (pausing ) I’d like to be happier. Th e r a p i s T: [reinforcing the patient] That’s a good goal. This goal, however, is too broad. It’s difficult to figure out how to help the patient become happier, so I ask Sally to specify in behavioral terms what being “happier” means to her. Th e r a p i s T: And if you were happier and not feeling depressed, what would you be doing? pa Ti e n T: I guess I would get involved in some activities at school, like I did last year . . . I’d have some fun and not feel so depressed all the time. Th e r a p i s T: Good, I’ll add these to the list: join school activities and do more fun activities. Goal l ist— february 11. Improve schoolwork. 2. Decrease worrying about tests and grades. 3. Spend more time with friends. 4. Join school activities. 5. Do more fun activities. Th e r a p i s T: Now, for homework, could you read through this list and see whether you have any other goals to add? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: (Adds this assignment to the Homework List . ) Okay, now before we go on, can I quickly summarize what we’ve done so far? We’ve set the agenda, talked about your diagnosis, and started a goal list. 70 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND In this part of the session, I made sure that the goal list was recorded in writing. I also guided Sally in specifying a general goal (“I’d like to be happier”) in behavioral terms. Rather than allowing a discussion of goals to dominate the session, I ask Sally to refine the list for homework. Finally, I summarized what we had discussed to that point. Doing so helps make the process of therapy more understandable and keeps us on track. Q: What if . . . a patient sets goals for someone else? A: Occasionally patients state a goal over which they do not have direct control: “I’d like my partner to be nicer to me”; “I want my boss to stop putting so much pressure on me”; “I want my kids to listen to me. ” In this case, it is important to help them phrase the goal so that it is something they do have control over:Th e r a p i s T: I don’t want to promise you that we can directly get Joe to be nicer to you. What do you think of phrasing it this way: “Learn new ways of talking to Joe. ” Maybe if you take control and change what you’re doing, it will have some impact on Joe. For a fuller discussion of what to do when patients set goals for others, see J. S. Beck (2005). EDUCATING THE P ATIENT ABOUT THE C OGNITIVE m ODE l An important feature of the initial session is helping patients under -stand how their thinking affects their reactions, preferably using their own examples. You can take advantage of patients’ spontaneous utter -ances in session (e. g. , “I can’t do anything right. Nothing can help. I’ll never feel better”). Or you can ask them, “What’s going through your mind right now? ” when you notice a shift in affect. It is probably easier, though, for the novice therapist to devote a portion of the first session providing psychoeducation about the relationship among triggering situations, automatic thoughts or images, and reactions (emotional, behavioral, and physiological). Th e r a p i s T: Can we talk for a few minutes about how your thinking affects your mood? Can you think of any time in the past few days when you noticed your mood change? When you were aware that you had become particularly upset? pa Ti e n T: I think so. Structure of the First Therapy Session 71 Th e r a p i s T: Can you tell me a little about it? pa Ti e n T: I was having lunch with a couple of people from my Eng -lish class, and I started to feel really bad. They were talking about something the professor had said in class that I didn’t really under -stand. Th e r a p i s T: Do you remember what you were thinking? pa Ti e n T: Ummm, that they’re much smarter than I am. That I’ll prob -ably flunk the course. Th e r a p i s T: (using Sally’s precise words ) So you had the thoughts “They’re much smarter than I am. I’ll probably flunk the course, ” and how did those thoughts make you feel emotionally? Happy, sad, wor -ried, angry. . . ? pa Ti e n T: Oh, sad, really sad. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, how about if we make a diagram? You just gave a good example of how, in a specific situation, your thoughts influ -ence your emotion. ( Composes the diagram below and reviews it with Sally. ) Is it clear to you? That how you viewed this situation led to automatic thoughts that then then influenced how you felt? pa Ti e n T: I think so. Situation: At lunch with classmatesAutomatic thoughts: “They’re much smarter than I am. I’ll probably flunk the course. ”Reaction (emotional): Sad Th e r a p i s T: Let’s see if we can gather a couple more examples from the past few days. Is there another time when you were feeling particu -larly upset? pa Ti e n T: Well, just a few minutes ago, when I was waiting in the waiting room. I was feeling really down. Th e r a p i s T: And what was going through your mind at the time? pa Ti e n T: I don’t remember exactly. Th e r a p i s T: [trying to make the experience more vivid in Sally’s mind] Can you imagine yourself back in the waiting room right now? Can you imagine sitting there? Describe the scene for me as if it’s hap -pening right now. pa Ti e n T: Well, I’m sitting in the chair near the door, away from the 72 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND receptionist. A woman comes in, she’s smiling and talking to the receptionist. She looks kind of happy and . . . normal. Th e r a p i s T: And how are you feeling as you look at her? pa Ti e n T: Kind of sad. Th e r a p i s T: What’s going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: She’s not like me. She’s happy. I’ll never be like that again. Th e r a p i s T: [reinforcing the cognitive model] Okay. That’s another good example. The situation was that you saw a happy-looking woman in the reception area and you thought, “I’ll never be like that again”—and that thought made you feel sad. Is this clear to you? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. I think so. Th e r a p i s T: [making sure Sally can verbalize her understanding of the cognitive model] Can you tell me in your own words about the con -nection between thoughts and feelings? pa Ti e n T: Well, it seems that my thoughts affect how I feel. Th e r a p i s T: Yes, that’s right. [facilitating Sally’s carrying through the work of the therapy session throughout the week] What I’d like you to do, if you agree, is to keep track this coming week of what’s going through your mind when you notice your mood changing or getting worse. Okay? pa Ti e n T: Uh-huh. Th e r a p i s T: In fact, how about if I write it down on the Homework List: When I notice my mood getting worse, ask, “What’s going through my mind? ” and jot down the thoughts . When you come in next week, we can evaluate your thoughts to see whether they’re 100% true, or 0% true, or someplace in the middle. Okay? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Lots of times, because you’re depressed, I think you’ll find that these thoughts aren’t completely accurate. I’ll write something down about that, too: Just because I think something doesn’t necessarily mean it’s true . When we find out your thoughts aren’t true, or not completely true, I’ll teach you how to look at the situation in a more realistic way. When you do that, I think you’ll find that you feel bet -ter. For example, we might find that your classmates aren’t much smarter than you, and that the reason you’re struggling has noth -ing to do with your intelligence, but has everything to do with the fact that you’re depressed. And we might then do some problem solving to help you with the course. For example, you might ask for help from a friend or a teaching assistant or a tutor. Structure of the First Therapy Session 73 pa Ti e n T: That sounds hard. Th e r a p i s T: That’s another good example of an automatic thought: “That sounds hard. ” Well, that’s what I’m here for. We’ll be working as a team, together, to help you solve your problems, and we’ll go step by step. ( pause ) Can you see how changing your thinking and doing some problem solving might help improve your mood? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: (Using an encouraging tone of voice . ) And I think you’ll find that you’ll get good at it pretty soon. Meanwhile, can you try to write down other depressed thoughts like that so we can look at them next session? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: [checking to see whether Sally anticipates difficulties that might require advance problem solving] Do you think you’ll have any trouble doing that? pa Ti e n T: No. I think I’ll be able to. Th e r a p i s T: Good. But even if you can’t, that’s okay. You’ll come back next week and we’ll work on it together. pa Ti e n T: Okay. In this section, I explain, illustrate, and record the cognitive model with the patient’s own examples . I try to limit my explanations to just a couple of sentences at a time; depressed patients, in particular, have difficulty concentrating. I also ask Sally to put what I’ve said in her own words so I can check on her understanding. Had Sally’s cognitive abilities been impaired or limited, I might have used more concrete learning aids such as faces with various expressions to illustrate emotions, and car -toon characters with empty “thought bubbles” above their heads. Q: What if . . . patients have difficulty grasping the cognitive model in the first session? A: You will decide whether to try other techniques (see Chapter 9), or whether to return to this task in the next session. Common sense dictates that you not push too hard, which could lead patients to have negative thoughts about their competence or about you. If you decide against further explication of the cognitive model at this point, take care to downplay the importance of the skill to reduce the probability that patients will blame themselves. (“Sometimes it’s hard to figure out these thoughts. Usually they’re so quick. It’s no big deal, though. We’ll come back to it another time. ”) 74 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND DISCUSSION O f PROB l Em OR B EHAVIORA l ACTIVATIONIf there is time in this first session, you will start discussing a specific problem of significant concern to the patient. Developing alternate ways of viewing the problem, or concrete steps patients can take to solve the problem, tends to increase their hopefulness that treatment will be effec -tive. Unless patients express a problem of overriding importance, try to elicit their agreement to discuss the problem of inactivity—that is, if they have withdrawn from activities or are generally at least somewhat inac -tive. Overcoming depressive passivity and creating opportunities to expe -rience pleasure and a sense of mastery is essential for most depressed patients. Behavioral activation is discussed in the next chapter. END-Of-SESSION S Umm ARY AND S ETTING Of HOm EWOR k The final summary ties together the threads of the session and rein -forces important points. The summary also includes a review of what the patient has agreed to do for homework. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, our time is almost up. Can you tell me what you think is most important for you to remember this week? You can look at your notes [page 67]. pa Ti e n T: Well, I guess that I’m not lazy. And I might have a lot of depressed thoughts that will make me feel bad, even if they’re not true. Th e r a p i s T: Right. And how about the idea that getting more active might help improve your mood? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Can we go over the homework now? I want to make sure it’s doable. ( pointing to the paper ) The first thing we wrote down is to remind yourself that you’re depressed, so you won’t start thinking that you’re no good. Now, how will you remember to do that? Do you think you could read this sheet of paper when you get up every morning? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: How long do you think it will take you? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. Maybe 5 minutes? Th e r a p i s T: Actually, I think it will take less than a minute. pa Ti e n T: Yeah, that’s probably right. Structure of the First Therapy Session 75 Th e r a p i s T: How will you remember to do it? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks . ) I’m not sure. I don’t want to keep it out because my roommate could see it. Th e r a p i s T: [making specific suggestions] Could you keep the paper somewhere else, like in your backpack? Maybe you could set an alarm on your cell phone, so when it beeps, you’ll remember to get it out and read it? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, that would work. Th e r a p i s T: It would also be good to read it at least once more every day. When do you think it would help most? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks . ) Probably right after dinner. Th e r a p i s T: That sounds good. Do you want to set an alarm for then, also? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: I’ll write that plan at the top of the sheet. Next, we add to the homework assignment sheet, noting aloud how long each task will probably take to accomplish. Many patients overesti -mate the difficulty and duration of tasks. Specifying time requirements help ease the perceived burden. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, we also talked earlier in the session about adding to your goal list this week. Do you think you could spend a minute or two on it this week? pa Ti e n T: Sure. Th e r a p i s T: And finally, I have a booklet here about depression [ Coping with Depression ; see Appendix B]. Should we make it optional? pa Ti e n T: (Nods . )Th e r a p i s T: I think it will take about 5 or 10 minutes to read. If you do read it, you can make mental notes or written notes on what you agree with and what you don’t. pa Ti e n T: Okay. In this part of the session, I want to maximize the chance that Sally will do the homework and feel successful. If you sense that the patient may not carry out any part of the assignment, you may offer to change it (“Do you think you’ll have trouble jotting down your thoughts? ” [If yes] “Do you think we should make it optional? ”). Depressed patients can easily become overwhelmed and then self-critical if they do not com -plete their homework assignments. (See Chapter 17 for an extended discussion of homework. ) 76 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND We also discussed when it would be helpful for Sally to read this sheet of paper. It is important to note that Sally, accustomed to doing homework for school, is less likely to be overwhelmed and more likely to follow through with these activities than another depressed patient might be. Some patients may decide to transfer this written list to their smartphone or other electronic device. f EEDBAC k The final element of every therapy session, at least initially, is feed -back. By the end of the first session, most patients feel positively about the therapist and the therapy. Eliciting feedback further strengthens rapport, providing the message that you care about what the patient thinks. It also gives patients a chance to express, and you to resolve, any misunderstandings. Patients may occasionally make an idiosyncratic interpretation of something you said or did. Asking them whether there was anything that bothered them gives them the opportunity to state and then to test their conclusions. In addition to verbal feedback, you may decide to have patients complete a written Therapy Report (see Figure 5. 2). Th e r a p i s T: Now at the end of each session, I’m going to ask how you thought the session went. You actually get two chances—telling me directly or writing it on a Therapy Report, which you can fill out in the waiting room after our session. I’ll read it over, and if there are any problems, we can put them on the agenda at our next session. Okay? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: Now, what did you think of today’s session? Was there any -thing about this session that bothered you or anything you thought I got wrong? pa Ti e n T: No, it was good. Th e r a p i s T: Anything you’d like us to do differently next session? pa Ti e n T: No, I don’t think so. Th e r a p i s T: Okay then. It was a pleasure working with you today. Would you please fill out the Therapy Report in the waiting room now and the other forms I gave you just before our session next week? And you’ll try to do the homework you wrote down on your homework sheet. Okay? pa Ti e n T: (Nods . ) Okay. Thanks. Th e r a p i s T: See you next week. 77 Reprinted by permission in Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Basics and Beyond, Second Edition , by Judith S. Beck (Guilford Press, 2011).

A: You will try to specify the problem and establish its meaning to the patient, then intervene or mark the problem for intervention at the next session, as in the following example:Th e r a p i s T: Now, was there anything about this session that both -ered you? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know . . . I’m not sure this therapy is for me. Th e r a p i s T: You don’t think it’ll help? pa Ti e n T: No, not really. You see, I’ve got real-life problems. It’s not just my thinking. Th e r a p i s T: I’m glad you told me. This gives me the opportunity to say that I do believe that you have real-life problems. I didn’t mean to imply that you don’t. The problems with your boss and your neighbors and your feelings of loneliness . . . Of course, those are all real problems; problems we’ll work together to solve. I don’t think that all we need to do is look at your thoughts. I’m sorry if I gave you that impression. pa Ti e n T: That’s okay . . . It’s just, like . . . well, I feel so overwhelmed. I don’t know what to do. Th e r a p i s T: Are you willing to come back next week so we can work on the overwhelmed feelings together? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, I guess so. Th e r a p i s T: Is the homework contributing to the overwhelmed feeling, too? pa Ti e n T: (pause ) Maybe. Th e r a p i s T: How would you like to leave it? We could make the homework optional, or some of it optional, if you want. pa Ti e n T: (sigh of relief ) Yeah, that would be better. Th e r a p i s T: What seems hardest to do? pa Ti e n T: Trying to keep track of my thoughts. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, let’s write “optional” next to that one. Or should I just cross it off? pa Ti e n T: No, you can write “optional. ”Th e r a p i s T: (Does so . ) What else feels too hard? pa Ti e n T: Maybe calling my friends. I don’t know if I’m up for that. Structure of the First Therapy Session 79 Th e r a p i s T: Okay, should I write “optional” or cross it off? pa Ti e n T: Maybe cross it off. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. ( Does so . ) Now, was there anything else that bothered you about today’s session? Here the therapist recognizes the necessity for strengthening the therapeutic alliance. The therapist had either missed signs of the patient’s dissatisfaction during the session or the patient was adept at concealing it. Had the therapist failed to ask for feedback about the session or been less adept at dealing with the negative feedback, it is possible that the patient would not have returned for another session. The therapist’s flexibility about the homework assignment helps the patient reexamine his misgivings about the appropriateness of cognitive behavior therapy. By responding to feedback and making reasonable adjustments, the therapist demonstrates understanding of and empathy toward the patient, which facilitates collaboration and trust. The therapist will make sure to express at the beginning of the next session how important it is that they work as a team to tailor the treatment and the homework so the patient finds them helpful. The therapist also uses this difficulty as an opportunity to refine the conceptualization of the patient. In the future, the therapist ensures that homework is set more collaboratively with the patient and that he does not feel overwhelmed. The initial therapy session has several important goals: establish -ing rapport; refining the conceptualization; socializing patients to the process and structure of cognitive behavior therapy; educating patients about the cognitive model and about their disorder(s); and providing hope and some symptom relief. Developing a solid therapeutic alliance and encouraging patients to join with you to accomplish therapeutic goals are of primary importance in this session. Chapter 7 describes the structure of subsequent therapy sessions and Chapter 8 deals with difficulties in structuring sessions. 80 Chapter 6 BEHAVIORAl ACTIVATIONOne of the most important initial goals for depressed patients is scheduling activities. Most have withdrawn from at least some activities that had previously given them a sense of achievement or pleasure and lifted their mood. And they frequently have increased certain behaviors (staying in bed, watching television, sitting around) that maintain or increase their current dysphoria. They often believe that they cannot change how they feel emotionally. Helping them to become more active and to give themselves credit for their efforts are essential parts of treatment, not only to improve their mood, but also to strengthen their sense of self-effi cacy by demonstrating to themselves that they can take more control of their mood than they had previously believed. CONCEPTUAl Iz ATION Of INACTIVITYWhen considering engaging in activities, patients’ depressed automatic thoughts frequently get in their way. Situation: Thinking about initiating an activity[Common] Automatic thoughts: “I’m too tired. I won’t enjoy it. My friends won’t want to spend time with me. I won’t be able to do it. Nothing can help me feel better. ” Behavioral Activation 81[Common] Emotional reactions: Sadness, anxiety, hopelessness[Common] Behavior: Remain inactive . Patients’ relative inactivity then contributes to their low mood, as they have a paucity of opportunities to gain a sense of mastery or plea -sure, which leads to more negative thinking, which leads to increased dysphoria and inactivity, in a vicious cycle. CONCEPTUA l Iz ATION O f l AC k Of m ASTERY OR Pl EASUREEven when patients do engage in various activities, they often derive low levels of satisfaction and pleasure because of their self-critical auto -matic thoughts. Situation: Engaging in an activity[Common] Automatic thoughts: “I’m doing a terrible job. I should have done this long ago. There’s still so much left to do. I can’t do this as well as I used to. This used to be more fun. I don’t deserve to be doing this. ”[Common] Emotional reactions: Sadness, guilt, anger at self[Common] Behaviors: Stop the activity. Push self beyond a reasonable point. Fail to repeat this activity in the future . Self-critical thoughts may arise as patients engage in activities or afterward, as they reflect on the results. When scheduling activities, it is important to anticipate automatic thoughts that could interfere with patients’ initiation of activities, as well as thoughts that could diminish patients’ sense of pleasure or achievement during or after an activity. When you are treating relatively “easy” patients like Sally, you will facilitate the identification of activities that could potentially help them feel better, address interfering thoughts, and assist them in putting pleasurable or productive activities in their schedule. You may need to help more severely depressed patients develop an hourly schedule of 82 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND activities for the week to counteract their extensive passivity and inactiv -ity. It may also be useful for some patients to rate their sense of pleasure and achievement following their activities, to examine whether becom -ing more active and responding to their dysfunctional thinking does improve their mood. Perhaps the easiest and quickest way to get patients behaviorally activated is to review their typical daily schedule (pages 50–52). The following questions can guide your discussion. Which activities are patients doing too little of, thus depriving • themselves of obtaining a sense of achievement (mastery), a sense of pleasure, or both? These might be activities related to work or school, family, friends, their neighborhood, volunteering, sports, hobbies, physical exercise, their household, nature, spirituality, or sensual, intellectual, or cultural pursuits. Do patients have a good balance of mastery and pleasure • experiences? for example, are patients driving themselves too hard, and so have a dearth of pleasure? Are they avoiding activities they predict will be challenging, and so have little opportunity to obtain a sense of mastery? Which activities are lowest in mastery and/or pleasure? Are these • activities inherently dysphoric, such as ruminating in bed, and so should their frequency be reduced? Or are patients feeling dysphoric during potentially rewarding activities because of their depressed thinking? In the following transcripts, I review Sally’s schedule with her, reinforce her conclusions about how she might better plan her time, encourage her to commit to specific changes, elicit the thoughts that might impede instituting the changes, label her thoughts as predictions that can be tested, give her the choice of a follow-up homework assign -ment, and teach her to give herself credit. Th e r a p i s T: Thinking about your schedule, what do you notice? How are your activities different from say, a year ago, when you weren’t depressed? pa Ti e n T: Well, I’m spending a lot of time in bed. Th e r a p i s T: Does staying in bed make you feel much better? Do you get out of bed feeling refreshed and energetic? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks . ) No . . . I guess not. I usually feel groggy and down when I get up. Behavioral Activation 83 Th e r a p i s T: Well, that’s valuable information. [providing psychoedu -cation] It seems most people who are depressed think they’ll feel better if they stay in bed. But they usually find that doing almost anything else is better . . . What else is different? pa Ti e n T: Last semester, I used to go out more with friends or just hang around with them. Now I just go from my dorm room, to class, to the library, to the cafeteria, and back to my room. Th e r a p i s T: Does that give you an idea of what you might like to change this coming week? pa Ti e n T: Yes, well, I’d like to spend more time with other people, but I just don’t seem to have any energy. Th e r a p i s T: So you end up staying in bed? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Well, that’s an interesting idea you have: “I don’t have the energy to spend time with people. ” Let’s write that down. [inquir -ing about setting up a behavioral experiment] Now, how could we test this idea to see if it’s true? pa Ti e n T: I guess I could plan to spend some time with my friends and see if I could do it. Th e r a p i s T: [trying to motivate Sally to do so] Would there be an advantage to doing that? pa Ti e n T: I guess I might feel better. I infer from Sally’s tone of voice that she might be reluctant to do the experiment. I conceptualize that automatic thoughts might be interfering. Situation: Discussing spending time with friendsAutomatic thought: ? ? Emotional reaction: Unspecified negative emotion To discover Sally’s automatic thought, I ask her directly:Th e r a p i s T: What’s going through your mind right now? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. Th e r a p i s T: [providing Sally with the opposite of what I actually believed she was thinking] Were you thinking what a good time you’d have with your friends? 84 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: No, I guess I’m worried that my friends won’t want to hang out with me. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. [reinforcing the cognitive model] Can you see how that thought might stop you from approaching them? I mentally hypothesize the following scenario:Situation: Thinking of hanging out with friendsAutomatic thought: “They won’t want to hang out with me. ”Emotional reaction: Sadness? likely behavioral reaction (if she doesn’t respond to the automatic thought): Stay in her room . Next, I determine whether Sally can devise her own response. When she cannot, I help her evaluate the validity of her thought and devise a behavioral experiment. Th e r a p i s T: How can you answer that thought? pa Ti e n T: . . . I don’t know. Th e r a p i s T: Do you have any evidence that they won’t want to hang out with you? pa Ti e n T: No, not really, not unless they’re busy . . . Except I’m not much fun these days. Th e r a p i s T: Have they said something? pa Ti e n T: No . . . Th e r a p i s T: Do you have any evidence on the other side—that maybe they would want to spend time with you? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks . ) Well, Emily asked me to go to lunch with her today, but I couldn’t. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, that sounds pretty good. So how could you find out for sure whether Emily or others would want to hang out? pa Ti e n T: I guess I could ask them if they want to have dinner or some -thing. Next I ask a series of questions to set up the behavioral experiment in a way that maximizes the chance of a positive outcome. Behavioral Activation 85 Th e r a p i s T: Who would be easiest for you to ask? Emily? pa Ti e n T: No, Allison and Joe, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Then you can test two of your predictions. One, that your friends won’t want to hang out, and two, that you’re too tired to spend time with them. Does that sound right? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: [trying to increase the likelihood that Sally will follow through] How likely are you to approach Allison and Joe or some -one else? pa Ti e n T: (in an affirmative tone of voice ) I’ll do it. Th e r a p i s T: [recognizing that Sally is more likely to do it if she does it immediately] Do you think you could do it today? pa Ti e n T: I guess I could. I could text them after the session. Th e r a p i s T: [giving positive reinforcement] That’s great. Then if it turns out okay, could you keep trying to get together for friends for the rest of the week? What do you think? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, okay. Th e r a p i s T: [hypothesizing that Sally might turn her friends off if she is too down] Do you want to talk about what to say to your friends about your depression? Or how to balance talking about it with some more upbeat things? pa Ti e n T: No, I don’t need to. They already know I’ve been down. They’re pretty supportive. Th e r a p i s T: Good . . . [predicting that Sally could feel worse if she’s turned down] Now, if it turns out that friends say no, do you think it will be important to remember that it might be because they’re busy, not because they don’t want to spend time with you? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: Should I write that down? pa Ti e n T: (Nods . )Th e r a p i s T: (writing ) “If they say no, it’s likely that they’d like to hang out with me but they’re too busy. ” ( pause ) Good. Now, can we go back to your schedule? Anything you think you need to change? pa Ti e n T: I guess I’m watching too much TV. Th e r a p i s T: Anything you’d like to try to replace it with this week? pa Ti e n T: I really don’t know. Th e r a p i s T: I notice you don’t seem to be spending much time doing physical activities—is that right? 86 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: Yeah. I used to run most mornings or swim. Th e r a p i s T: What’s gotten in the way of your doing these things lately? pa Ti e n T: Same thing as before, I guess. I’ve felt really tired. And I didn’t think I’d enjoy it. Situation: Thinking about getting exerciseAutomatic thoughts: “I’m too tired. I won’t enjoy it. ”Emotional reaction: DysphoriaBehavioral reaction: Stays in bed . Th e r a p i s T: Would you like to plan more exercise, say, going for a short run or swim a few times this week? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: How likely is it that you’ll make plans to see friends and swim or run—maybe at least three times? pa Ti e n T: Oh, I will. Th e r a p i s T: Should we write these things on an activity chart [see Fig -ure 6. 1] so you’ll be more likely to commit to them? pa Ti e n T: No, I don’t need to. I’ll do them. Th e r a p i s T: One more thing. Do you think you could give yourself credit every time you do one of these things? You could just say, “Good. I did it. ”pa Ti e n T: (Looking quizzical . ) You mean you want me to give myself credit for making plans with my friends? Th e r a p i s T: Absolutely. [providing psychoeducation] When people are depressed, it’s often difficult for them to do things that they used to do easily. Doing things like calling a friend or going for just a short run are really important in starting to get yourself over the depression. And they do take more energy than lying in bed. So of course you deserve credit. pa Ti e n T: But those things used to be easy. Th e r a p i s T: When you’re over the depression, you don’t have to give yourself credit. But if they’re even a little bit difficult to do now, you do deserve credit. And reminding yourself of that will help you recognize that you’re doing something productive to get better. 87 Reprinted by permission in Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Basics and Beyond, Second Edition , by Judith S.

Th e r a p i s T: In fact, I’d like you to give yourself credit whenever you do something active—that is, whenever you’re not napping or watching TV or surfing the Web. [See pages 274–276 for a further description of giving oneself credit. ]In this segment, I lead Sally to draw conclusions from a review of her typical day. Some patients need more guidance than others to do this (e. g. , “Do you notice how much time you spend in bed? What is your mood like when you get up—do you feel much better? What changes do you think you might like to try this week? ”). I guide Sally to commit to implementing specific changes and identify automatic thoughts that might interfere, proposing behavioral experiments to test the validity of her negative predictions. I also ask her to give herself credit when -ever she is active. Q: What if . . . patients believe they are incapable of becoming more active, or that becoming more active will not improve their mood? A: You will provide education, set up behavioral experiments to help patients test their thoughts, and use an activity chart, as below. Th e r a p i s T: [summarizing a review of the patient’s typical day] Okay, so it seems as if your activities changed a lot when you got depressed. pa Ti e n T: Yes, I just don’t have much energy. I just lie around the house most of the time. Th e r a p i s T: And what’s your mood been like? pa Ti e n T: Pretty bad. I’m depressed all the time. Th e r a p i s T: And what do you think will happen if you keep lying around the house? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. Nothing, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: So you’ll keep being depressed? pa Ti e n T: I guess so. Th e r a p i s T: What would you think about trying to make a bet -ter schedule for yourself, planning some things to do that could give you a sense of pleasure or achievement, like calling friends or going for walks? pa Ti e n T: I don’t think it would help. And I’m so tired all the time. I think I should wait until I’m feeling better. 90 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: You know, that’s exactly what most people with depres -sion say. But research shows us that it’s actually the opposite. The way people get over their depression is to get more active first—then they start to feel better. pa Ti e n T: Oh. Th e r a p i s T: Would you be willing to do an experiment this week—to see whether you’re too tired, and to see what happens to your mood if you do try to do more things? pa Ti e n T: I guess so. Th e r a p i s T: Let’s see. [providing a contrast among energy required for various activities] What are some things you know for sure would be too hard? Running? Doing errands for an entire day? Cleaning up your whole apartment? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, I couldn’t do those things. Th e r a p i s T: So what’s something on the other side, something that takes just a little energy? pa Ti e n T: (Sighs . ) I could go to the library. Return my overdue book and maybe get some DVDs. Th e r a p i s T: [providing positive reinforcement] Good idea! What else could you do? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: Do you think you could do a few tasks a day—if they were only for 10 minutes each? pa Ti e n T: I guess I could. Th e r a p i s T: Good. The therapist helps the patient specify these tasks and con -tinues to elicit additional activities, then requests that the patient use an activity chart. Th e r a p i s T: These are all good activities. ( pulling out the Activity Chart in Figure 6. 2 ) I’d like to figure out with you when you might do these things. Is it okay if we write them down on this chart? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: (looking at the description of the patient’s typical day ) So, it looks as if you usually get up around 11:00 or 11:30. What would you think about getting up by 10:00 and 10:30 in the morning? 91 m ON. TUE. WED. THU. f RI. SAT.

Th e r a p i s T: So that’s a change from what you usually do? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, sometimes I don’t get dressed all day. Th e r a p i s T: How about if you write down, in the 10 o’clock space, “Get up, shower, get dressed. ” And then write “Have break -fast” in the 11 o’clock space. ” [See Figure 6. 2. ]pa Ti e n T: Okay. ( Does so . )Th e r a p i s T: Now, what do want to do after breakfast? Wash your breakfast dishes? pa Ti e n T: I should. I’ve been letting dishes pile up in the sink. The kitchen is kind of a mess. Th e r a p i s T: So, how about doing dishes or cleaning up the kitchen for 10 minutes? You don’t have to finish everything at once. pa Ti e n T: (sigh of relief ) Okay. Th e r a p i s T: And then after the dishes? Do you want to take a break, watch TV or read the newspaper or surf the Web like you usually do? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, that would be good. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, so in the 11 o’clock space, let’s put “clean kitchen for 10 minutes, ” and in the 12 o’clock space put “TV or news -paper or surf the Web. ”The therapist and patient continue in this vein until they have made a schedule for the next day. Because the patient has been so inactive, the therapist takes care not to overwhelm him by creat -ing too busy a schedule. She builds in short periods of activity with longer periods of leisure activity or rest. She also asks the patient to give himself credit every time he follows the schedule. Next she asks the patient if he is willing to try to follow the same basic schedule every day. They make lists of potential tasks the patient could do at home, people he could call, and places he could go. At the following session, the therapist reviews this homework assignment of following the schedule. She asks the patient about his previous predictions: that he would be too tired to do activi -ties and that they would not help. Discovering that his automatic thoughts were inaccurate can motivate the patient to get up ear -lier and engage in a greater number of productive or pleasurable activities. 94 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Q: What if . . . patients can’t come up with any pleasurable activities? A: There are many lists from which patients can choose activities. See, for example, Frisch (2005) or a list described in Mac Phillamy and Lewinsohn (1982), which can be accessed at: www. healthnet -solutions. com/dsp/Pleasant Events Schedule. pdf . It is useful to give a forced choice when reviewing a list with a patient: “Which five or 10 activities from the list do you think could be most enjoy -able? ” If patients are reluctant, it is useful to help them recognize that staying in bed maintains or increases their dysphoria. Then ask them whether they think engaging in a given activity from the list is likely to make their mood worse than staying in bed. If they reply no, ask them whether they are willing to schedule the activity. If they say yes, ask them whether they are willing to do a behavioral experiment to see if they are right. Q: What if . . . patients are already fully scheduled or overscheduled? A: If patients already have a good balance of activities, they may not need to change their schedule. If the balance is not good, they may need to build in some rest time and/or increase the number of pleasurable and/or mastery activities. If they are overscheduled, they may need to decrease their activity level. (They also need to give themselves credit for making any of these changes. ) In any case, if they do not gain a sense of pleasure and mastery from their activities, they may need your help in responding to the dys -functional cognitions they are experiencing. They may also need to respond to automatic thoughts that interfere with changing their activities. Q: What if . . . patients report that changing their activities has no impact on their mood? A: Except in the most severe cases of depression, it is unlikely that patients experience no fluctuations in how they feel. But the fluc -tuations may be small, and patients may not remember them. For these patients, it is helpful to teach them to rate their sense of achievement and mastery on 10-point scales and to rate their mood immediately following their activities, as below. Th e r a p i s T: [summarizing a review of the patient’s homework] So you did a lot of things this week that we predicted could lift your mood, but you found that nothing helped? Your mood was the same, no matter what you did? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Behavioral Activation 95 Th e r a p i s T: I have two theories. One, you had interfering auto -matic thoughts. And/or two, maybe you did experience slight mood changes, but you either didn’t notice them or don’t remember them. pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. The therapist then elicits the cognitions the patient had when engaging in various activities and helps him respond to them, in anticipation of their re-occurrence in the coming week. The ther -apist also ascertains that the patient had neglected to give himself credit. Next they decide to have the patient rate the sense of mas -tery and pleasure he gets. Th e r a p i s T: Suppose we make up a pleasure scale first so you’ll have a guideline to rate your activities [see Figure 6. 3]. Now on a scale from 0 to 10, what activity would you call a 10? An activity that has given you great pleasure or that you could imagine giving you great pleasure? pa Ti e n T: Oh, I guess that would be when I went to the champion -ship game [of his home football team]. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, next to “10” write “At football game” on the chart. pa Ti e n T: (Does so . )Th e r a p i s T: Now, what would you call a 0? An activity that gives you absolutely no pleasure? pa Ti e n T: That would be arguing with my partner. Th e r a p i s T: All right, write that next to 0. pa Ti e n T: (Does so . )Th e r a p i s T: And what would be something midway in between? Pleasure Mastery 10 Arguing with partner Building the deck 5 Dinner with brother Raking leaves last year 0 At football game Bouncing a check FIGURE 6. 3. Pleasure and Mastery Rating Scale. 96 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: I guess . . . having dinner with my brother. Th e r a p i s T: Good, write that. If the patient can easily match activities with numbers, these three anchor points are usually sufficient, although the patient can add more points if desired. If the patient has difficulty with numbers, you can change the anchor points to “low, ” “medium, ” and “high. ” After completing the pleasure scale, the patient fills out the accomplishment scale in the same way. Next the therapist asks the patient to use his scales to rate today’s activities. Th e r a p i s T: That’s good. Now let’s have you fill in a little of today’s schedule. Here—it’s the 11 o’clock block—write “therapy” and under that, “A = ” and “P = . ” Now how much of a sense of accomplishment or mastery have you felt during therapy today? pa Ti e n T: About a 3. Th e r a p i s T: And pleasure? pa Ti e n T: About a 2. ( Fills in the blocks . )Th e r a p i s T: And what did you do in the hour right before therapy today? pa Ti e n T: I went to the bookstore. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. Write “bookstore” in the 10 o’clock block. Now, look at the scale. How much of a sense of accomplishment did you get during that hour? pa Ti e n T: Maybe 2 or 3. ( Writes it down . ) I found the book I wanted. Th e r a p i s T: And pleasure? pa Ti e n T: None, really. Th e r a p i s T: So being at the bookstore was like arguing with your partner? pa Ti e n T: No, I guess it was about a 2. Th e r a p i s T: But isn’t that interesting? Your first reaction was that you got no pleasure at all. The depression probably interferes with recognizing, or maybe remembering, pleasurable activi -ties. That’s why I think it’s worth your keeping this activity chart this week, to find out whether some activities are better than others. ( pause ) Do you think you’re straight on what to do? Behavioral Activation 97 pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: Could you tell me why it might be worth the effort to do all this? pa Ti e n T: Well, it sounds like you’re saying that maybe my mood does change some, based on what I’m doing. Th e r a p i s T: What do you think? pa Ti e n T: I guess that could be right. Th e r a p i s T: If that’s true, we can try to schedule more activities that do make you feel better next week. Now, the ideal thing would be to have you fill this out as close to the time you fin -ish an activity as you can—so you won’t forget what you did, and so your ratings will be more accurate. If that’s impossible, could you try to fill this out at lunch, dinner, and bedtime? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, it shouldn’t be a problem. Th e r a p i s T: And if you can fill it out every day, that would give us the most information. But even if you just do a couple of days, that would give us some. Now one last thing. How about if you look over the activity chart the day before our next session? See if there are any patterns, or anything you can learn from it. You can write down your conclusions on the back if you want. Okay? pa Ti e n T: Okay. USING THE A CTIVITY C HART TO A SSESS THE A CCURACY O f PREDICTIONSWhen patients are skeptical that scheduling activities can help, you can ask them to predict levels of mastery and pleasure or mood on one activ -ity chart and then record actual ratings on another. These comparisons can be a useful source of data. Th e r a p i s T: Let’s take a look now at your predictions on the first activ -ity chart and what actually happened on the second one. pa Ti e n T: (Nods . )Th e r a p i s T: Let’s see . . . it looks as if you predicted very low scores, mostly 0’s to 3’s, for these three times you scheduled to meet your friends. What did happen? pa Ti e n T: Actually, I had a better time than I’d thought—my pleasure scores were 3’s to 5’s. 98 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: What does that tell you? pa Ti e n T: I guess I’m not a good predictor. I thought I wouldn’t enjoy myself, but I did, at least some. Th e r a p i s T: Would you like to schedule more social activities for this coming week? pa Ti e n T: Yes, I should. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Do you see what could have happened—and, in fact, what was happening before you came to therapy? You kept predicting that you’d have a lousy time with your friends so you didn’t make any plans; in fact, you turned down their invitations. It sounds as if this therapy homework helped you test your ideas; you found it was wrong that you’d have a lousy time, and now it sounds as if you’re more willing to schedule more. Is that right? pa Ti e n T: Yes. But that reminds me, I wanted to talk about one predic -tion that actually turned out worse. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, when was that? pa Ti e n T: I predicted that I’d get 4’s in accomplishment and pleasure when I went running over the weekend. But both were 1’s. Th e r a p i s T: Do you have any idea why? pa Ti e n T: Not really. Th e r a p i s T: How were you feeling when you were running? pa Ti e n T: Mostly frustrated. Th e r a p i s T: And what was going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. I wasn’t feeling very good. I got winded real eas -ily. I couldn’t believe how hard it was. Th e r a p i s T: Did you have thoughts like that—”I don’t feel very good, ” “I’m winded, ” “This is hard”? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, I think so. Th e r a p i s T: Anything else go through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I remembered how it used to be. I could go 2 or 3 miles with -out getting too winded. Th e r a p i s T: Did you have a memory, an image of how it used to be? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. It was easy. I’m in really bad shape now. It’s going to be so hard to get back in shape. I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to get back in shape. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, let me see if I understand. [summarizing] Here in my office you thought you’d get a moderate sense of accomplish -ment and pleasure when you went running. But instead, you got very little. It sounds as if you had a memory of how it used to be and Behavioral Activation 99 you also had thoughts that interfered, such as, “This is hard, ” “I’m real winded, ” “I used to do this easily, ” “I’m in such bad shape now, ” “Maybe I’ll never be able to get back in shape. ” And these thoughts made you feel frustrated. Does that sound right? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. In this last part, the therapist uses the activity chart as a vehicle for identifying a number of automatic thoughts that were undermining the patient’s enjoyment of an activity. In the next part, the therapist will:1. Help him evaluate a key cognition, “Maybe I’ll never be able to get back in shape. ”2. Teach him to compare himself to how he was at his worst point instead of his best point, so he can feel good about running instead of being so self-critical. Behavioral activation is essential for most depressed patients. Many patients need only to be provided with a rationale, guidance in select -ing and scheduling activities, and responses to predicted automatic thoughts that might interfere with implementing the activities or with gaining a sense of pleasure or mastery from them. Therapists often need to be gently persistent in helping patients become more active. Patients who are quite inactive initially benefit from learning how to create and adhere to a daily schedule with increasing degrees of activ -ity. Patients who are skeptical about scheduling activities may benefit from doing behavioral experiments to test their ideas, and/or checking the accuracy of their automatic thoughts by comparing their predic -tions to what actually occurs. 100 Chapter 7 SESSION 2 AND BEYOND: STRUCTURE AND f ORm ATSession 2 uses a format that is repeated in every subsequent ses-sion. This chapter presents the format and describes the general course of therapy from Session 2 to near termination. The fi nal phase of treatment is described in Chapter 18, and typical problems that arise in socializing the patient during early sessions are presented in Chap-ter 8. The typical agenda for the second session and beyond is as fol-lows:Initial Part of Session 1. Do a mood check. 2. Set the agenda. 3. Obtain an update. 4. Review homework. 5. Prioritize the agenda. Middle Part of Session 6. Work on a specifi c problem and teach cognitive behavior therapy skills in that context. Structure and Format 101 7. follow-up discussion with relevant, collaboratively set homework assignment(s). 8. Work on second problem. End of Session 9. Provide or elicit a summary. 10. Review new homework assignments. 11. Elicit feedback. If you are new to this format, you can make a copy of this chart to keep with you. You can show it (or a simplified version) to patients so they can get a better idea of what treatment will be like, and so the two of you can keep track of where you are in the session. Your goals during this second session are to help patients identify important problems on which to work and, in the context of problem solving, you will teach patients relevant skills, especially identifying and responding to automatic thoughts and, for most depressed patients, scheduling activities. You will continue to socialize patients into cog -nitive behavior therapy: following the session format, working collab -oratively, providing feedback, and starting to view their past and ongo -ing experience in light of the cognitive model. If the patient is feeling somewhat better, you will also start relapse prevention work (see Chap -ter 18). Above all, you are concerned with building the therapeutic alli -ance and providing symptom relief. THE f IRST P ART O f THE S ESSIONThe specific goals of the introductory part of the session, described below, are to:Reestablish rapport. • Elicit the names of problems patients want help in solving. • Collect data that may indicate other important problem areas • to discuss. Review homework. • Prioritize the problems on the agenda. • The achievement of these goals is facilitated when patients review the Preparing for Therapy Worksheet (Figure 7. 1) prior to the session (either mentally or in writing). 102 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Mood (and Medication) Check The mood check is usually brief. It helps you and patients keep track of how they are progressing. If patients complete symptom checklists, you will examine them to determine whether patients have additional problems that they may not report verbally, such as suicidal ideation, difficulties sleeping, feeling worthless or punished, fearing the worst will happen, increased irritability, and so on. It may be important to address one or more of these problems during the session. You will also elicit a subjective description from patients and match it with objective test scores. If there is a discrepancy between the test scores and the self-report, question the patient (e. g. , “So you’ve been feeling worse, but your depression inventory is actually lower than last week. What do you make of that? ”). You will also make a quick compari -son between the objective scores of the previous session and the present objective scores (e. g. , “Your anxiety score is lower this week than last. Have you been feeling less anxious? ”). You should also confirm that patients are not reporting how they feel just that day, but instead are providing an overview of their mood for the past week. A typical second session begins as follows:Th e r a p i s T: Hi, Sally. How have you been feeling? pa Ti e n T: About the same, I guess. I’m still feeling pretty depressed. And a lot more worried. Th e r a p i s T: Can I take a look at your forms? When you filled them out, were you thinking about the week as a whole—or just today? pa Ti e n T: The whole week. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Okay, yes, it sure looks like you were much more anxious this week. Should we put “anxiety” on the agenda to talk about in a few minutes? 1. What did we talk about last session that was important? What do my therapy notes say? 2. What has my mood been like, compared to other weeks? 3. What happened (positive and negative) this week that my therapist should know? 4. What problems do I want help in solving? What is a short name for each of these problems? 5. What homework did I do? (If I didn’t do it, what got in the way? ) What did I learn? FIGURE 7. 1. Preparing for Therapy Worksheet. Structure and Format 103 pa Ti e n T: (Nods . )Th e r a p i s T: (indicating the Beck Depression Inventory ) It looks like your depression score is down a little this week, compared to last week. Did it feel that way to you? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, I think so. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, that’s good. Q: What if . . . patients elaborate at length about their mood? A: You will socialize them to give a concise description. For exam -ple:“Sally, can I interrupt you for a moment? Can you tell me in just a couple of sentences how your depression and anxiety have been this week compared to last week? Have you been feeling more depressed, about the same, or less depressed? ”Having gained an overall sense of Sally’s mood in the past week, I elicit her attribution for the change. I want her to recognize the positive actions she took and the adaptive changes in her thinking. Th e r a p i s T: Why do you think you’re a little less depressed? pa Ti e n T: I guess I’ve been feeling a little more hopeful, like maybe therapy might help. Th e r a p i s T: [subtly reinforcing the cognitive model] So you had thoughts like, “Therapy might help, ” and those thoughts made you feel more hopeful, less depressed? pa Ti e n T: Yes . . . and Lisa—she’s in my chemistry class—asked me to study with her. We spent a couple of hours yesterday going over some formulas. That made me feel better, too. Th e r a p i s T: What went through your mind when you were studying with her yesterday? pa Ti e n T: That I was glad she asked me to study with her . . . I under -stand it more now. Th e r a p i s T: So we have two good examples of why you felt better this week. One, you had hopeful thoughts about therapy. And two, you did something different—studying with Lisa—and got at least a small sense of achievement. pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: Can you see how your thinking and what you did affected how you felt—in a positive way? 104 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND To build a sense of self-efficacy and to encourage further cognitive and behavioral change, I positively reinforce Sally for the adaptive changes she made:Th e r a p i s T: It’s great that you were having these hopeful thoughts about therapy and that you made the effort to study with Lisa. If patients have been feeling better but are unsure why, ask, “Have you noticed any changes in your thinking or in what you’ve been doing? ”Q: What if . . . patients attribute positive changes in their mood to external factors? A: Patients often say, “I felt better because the medication started working/my boss was out sick/my partner was nicer to me. ” You might then suggest, “I’m sure that helped, but did you also find yourself thinking differently or doing anything different? ”Likewise, you will seek patients’ attributions if their mood has wors -ened: “Why do you think you’re feeling worse this week? Could it have anything to do with your thinking, or with the things you did or didn’t do? ” In this way, you subtly reinforce the cognitive model and imply that patients can take some control over how they feel. Q: What if . . . patients state that nothing can improve their mood? A: For some patients who persist in this belief, it might be helpful to put “Things that can help me feel better and things that can help me feel worse” on the agenda to discuss later in session. A chart such as the one in Figure 7. 2 can help reinforce the notion that patients can take at least minimal control of their mood. Through guided discovery, you can help them see that avoidance, isolation, Things that make me feel better Things that make me feel worse Riding my bike Getting through my e-mails Going on f acebookmeeting up with friends Working on the car Staying in bed Taking long naps Watching too much TVSitting around FIGURE 7. 2. A better/worse list. Structure and Format 105 and inactivity generally increase their dysphoria (or at least does not improve it), while engagement in certain activities (usually that involve interpersonal interaction or that have the potential for pleasure or mastery) can lead to an improvement in their mood, even if initially it is small. The brief mood check creates several opportunities:You demonstrate your concern for how patients have been • feeling in the past week. You and they can monitor how they have been progressing over • the course of treatment. You can identify (and then reinforce or modify) their explanation • for progress or lack thereof. You can also reinforce the cognitive model; namely, how patients • have been viewing situations and how they have been behaving have influenced their mood. When reviewing objective measures, make sure to review individual items to look for important positive or negative changes (e. g. , changes in suicidal ideation or hopelessness). According to patients’ diagnoses and symptomatology, you might also ask for additional information not specifically covered in the tests (e. g. , number and severity of panic attacks, binges, substance use, angry outbursts, self-harm, destructive behavior). If patients are taking medication for their psychological difficul -ties, you will briefly check on adherence, problems, side effects, or questions. It is important to phrase the adherence question in terms of frequency—not “Did you take your medicine this week, ” but rather, “How many times this week were you able to take your medicine the way [the provider] prescribed? ” (See, e. g. , J. S. Beck, 2001, for suggestions on how to increase medication adherence. )If you are not the prescribing healthcare provider, you will obtain patients’ permission and then periodically contact the provider to exchange information. You will not recommend changes in medica -tion, but you might help patients respond to cognitions that interfere with their taking medication (or, if applicable, reducing medication). If they have concerns about issues such as side effects, dosage, addiction to medications, or alternative medications or supplements, you will help patients write down specific questions to ask their provider. If patients are not taking medication but you believe a pharmacological intervention is indicated, you might suggest a medical or psychiatric consultation. 106 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Setting an Initial Agenda The purpose of this brief segment is to set an initial agenda. You social -ize patients into bringing up the names of problems they want help in solving. Rather than asking, “What do you want to talk about today? ” or “What do you want to put on the agenda? ”(which can lead to less pro -ductive discussions), you phrase the question in a problem-solving way (until patients are socialized to setting the agenda in this way):Th e r a p i s T: Okay, Sally, what problem or problems do you want my help in solving today? Can you just tell me the names of the problems? pa Ti e n T: Well, I’ve got this economics exam coming up and I just don’t understand the material. I’ve been so worried. I just can’t concen -trate. I don’t know what to do. I keep reading . . . Th e r a p i s T: (gently interrupting ) [socializing the patient into briefly specifying a problem to be discussed later in the session] Should we put the exam on the agenda? pa Ti e n T: Yes, definitely. Rather than having Sally provide a full description of the problem at this point, I gently interrupt her, name the problem, and ask to put it on the agenda to discuss in a few minutes. Had I allowed her to launch into a lengthier description of the problem, I would have deprived her of the opportunity to reflect on and prioritize what she most wanted to talk about during the session , which may or may not have been the first problem she brought up. Next I probe for additional important agenda topics:Th e r a p i s T: Are there any other problems you want help with? pa Ti e n T: Well, things aren’t going too well with my roommate. We keep such different hours. She . . . Th e r a p i s T: (gently interrupting ) Should we call that, “problem with your roommate”? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Anything else? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: [probing for other problems that might be even more important to address during the session than these first two] When did you feel the worst this week? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks . ) I guess when I was trying to study for the exam. And in class. Th e r a p i s T: Any other times that were particularly bad? pa Ti e n T: No, those were the worst. Structure and Format 107 Th e r a p i s T: Should we put “studying and class” on the agenda? pa Ti e n T: Yes, that would be good. I then ascertain whether the patient anticipates the occurrence of other important difficulties before I see her again:Th e r a p i s T: And are there any other problems you think are likely to come up this week? pa Ti e n T: No, I don’t think so. Q: What if . . . patients have difficulty coming up with agenda items? A: Often patients need a little encouragement initially to suggest agenda items. They may not be clearly cognizant of what has been bothering them, and/or they may be unsure of what is appropri -ate to bring up. Chapter 8 describes what to do with patients who display this difficulty. Update of Week The next part of the session helps you make a bridge between the pre -vious session and the current one. It includes a brief update of the patient’s week, during which you will remain alert for potential prob -lems that could be important for the agenda. First you seek to get the general gist of how the patient’s week went. Th e r a p i s T: Did anything else happen this week that’s important for me to know? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks . ) Ummm. ( sigh) Yeah, I overslept and missed a class. Th e r a p i s T: [probing to see whether it is important enough to add to the agenda] Is that a problem we need to talk about today? pa Ti e n T: No, I don’t think so. I just forgot to set my alarm. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, anything else? pa Ti e n T: No, not that I can think of. Next you will elicit positive experiences:Th e r a p i s T: All right. Now, can you tell me what happened this week that was positive? Or situations in which maybe you felt a little bit better? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks . ) Umm, I think running helped. I also felt better when I talked to my mom on the phone. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, that’s good. Were there any other good things that happened? 108 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Asking for positive experiences helps patients realize that they did not feel the same unrelenting severity of distress for the entire week. You should note the positive data, which you may use later in the session or in future sessions, especially when planning positive activities for patients to engage in or when helping them evaluate relevant automatic thoughts and beliefs. Uncovering positive data may also put patients in a better frame of mind, making them more receptive to upcoming prob -lem solving. You may decide to engage patients conversationally about these items (usually briefly), either at the time or later, to brighten their mood or to demonstrate your interest in them, thereby strengthening the therapeutic alliance. Homework Review Next you will find out what the patient accomplished for homework. (Chapter 17 provides a more extensive description of this part of the session. ) Reviewing the patient’s homework is critical. If you do not, patients invariably stop doing it. Sometimes the review of homework is relatively brief; at other times, however, it may become the major part of the session, if it is related to the problems on the agenda. Part of the art of therapy is determining how much time to spend reviewing homework versus discussing other problems the patient wants help in solving. Generally you ask patients to read aloud the assignments from their Homework List (see, e. g. , page 67). You ask them to rate how much they currently believe the adaptive statements, the responses to their auto -matic thoughts and beliefs you discussed in the previous sessions(s). You find out which behavioral assignments they did and what they learned from them. And you discuss which assignments would be helpful for them to continue in the coming week. If any homework items require a lengthy discussion (or if there are any assignments they failed to do), you can collaboratively decide to discuss them later in the session, so you can quickly review the rest of the assignments. Th e r a p i s T: Next, can we talk about your homework? Do you have the notes from last week? pa Ti e n T: Yes ( Pulls out list [Figure 5. 1, page 67]; therapist pulls out her copy, too . )Th e r a p i s T: Good. Okay if we go through it? pa Ti e n T: Sure. Th e r a p i s T: So how did you do with reading this twice a day? pa Ti e n T: Pretty good. I think I only missed one or two days. Structure and Format 109 Th e r a p i s T: Can you read the first item? pa Ti e n T: (Reads aloud . ) “If I start thinking I’m lazy and no good, remind myself that I have a real illness, called depression, that makes it harder for me to do things. As the treatment starts to work, my depression will lift, and things will get easier. ”Th e r a p i s T: How much do you believe that right now? pa Ti e n T: I guess I do believe it. Th e r a p i s T: Good. ( going on to second item on list ) Did you think of any other goals? pa Ti e n T: No. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. If you do, let me know. ( Moving on to third item ) Were you able to catch your automatic thoughts when you noticed your mood changing? pa Ti e n T: I tried, but I don’t think I always know what I’m thinking. Th e r a p i s T: That’s okay. We’ll be talking about automatic thoughts at every session. Were you able to identify any automatic thoughts when your mood changed? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, I think so, but I didn’t write them down. Th e r a p i s T: What was the situation? pa Ti e n T: I was sitting in class, and all of a sudden I got really nervous. Th e r a p i s T: What was going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I was thinking the exam was coming up, and there’s no way I’ll be ready for it. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Let me jot that down. Can we get back to this thought in a few minutes when we talk about the exam? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: Any other automatic thoughts you were aware of this week? pa Ti e n T: Not really. Th e r a p i s T: So you didn’t get much of an opportunity to remind your -self that just because you think something doesn’t necessarily mean it’s true? pa Ti e n T: (Shakes her head . )Th e r a p i s T: What do you think of that idea now? pa Ti e n T: I guess it’s true. Like the Coping with Depression booklet says. Th e r a p i s T: Did you get together with Allison or Joe or other people this week? 110 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Sally and I quickly review this assignment. We collaboratively agree that she will continue to look for her automatic thoughts and make social plans in the coming week. Then we briefly discuss key concepts in the Coping with Depression booklet. Prioritizing the Agenda Now that you have set an initial agenda and possibly added more top -ics as you collected data about the patient’s week and homework, you will summarize the topics. If there are too many agenda items, you and the patient will collaboratively prioritize items and agree to move the discussion of less important problems to a future session. You may also find out whether patients want to spend about an equal amount of time on each item. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, can we prioritize the agenda now [providing a ratio -nale] so we can figure out how to spend our time this session? You mentioned your exam, a problem with your roommate, and feeling particularly worse when you were studying and in class. (pause ) Is there any other problem that is even more important than those? pa Ti e n T: Well, I’ve been feeling bad about not calling my cousin. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. ( jotting it down and then adding my own items to the agenda ) I’d also like to talk about how you can expect your mood to improve and some more about automatic thoughts. Does that sound okay? pa Ti e n T: Yes, that’s fine. Th e r a p i s T: Anything else for the agenda? pa Ti e n T: I don’t think so. Th e r a p i s T: I don’t know if we’ll get to everything. [helping Sally priori -tize her problems] If we run out of time, are there some things we can put off until next week? pa Ti e n T: Ummm . . . I guess the problem with my roommate. It’ll prob -ably just blow over. And my cousin. That can wait. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, let’s put those last on our list, and we’ll see if we get to them. Alternatively, you can ask:Th e r a p i s T: If we only have time to talk about one or two of these prob -lems, which would be the most important? Structure and Format 111 It is important to note that you need not always adhere to the agenda. Indeed, under some circumstances, you should not follow the agenda. When deviating from the agenda, however, you should explic -itly note the change and elicit the patient’s agreement. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, I can see that you’re still worried about your exam, but we’re running out of time. Would you like to spend the rest of the session on it and postpone our other agenda items to next week? Or we could try to spend just 5 more minutes on it, so we’ll still have time to talk about feeling bad when you’re studying or in class. pa Ti e n T: I guess we should try to get to those things, too. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, let’s both keep an eye on the clock. You might suggest a change in how you and a patient spend time during a session for a number of reasons. For example, as in the previ -ous transcript, the patient is quite upset about a particular issue and needs more time to discuss it. Or a new topic arises that seems espe -cially important. Or the patient’s mood changes (for the worse) during the session. Q: What if . . . patients start talking about a whole new topic that is not on the agenda? A: When patients drift into a new topic, you gently interrupt them, calling attention to the change and allowing the patient to make a conscious choice of which issue to pursue. Patients frequently introduce new topics without quite realizing they are doing so. pa Ti e n T: Then another time I was trying to study in the library and I got so distracted when I saw this girl from my high school, Julia. I just started to obsess over whether I should go talk to her. When we were in 10 th grade, Julia was pretty friendly, and then something happened, I’m not sure what it was. I think she may have . . . Th e r a p i s T: Can I just interrupt you for a moment? We started off talking about the trouble you’ve been having studying for your exam, and now it sounds as if the focus is Julia. Is it more important to you to go back to talking about the exam, or is Julia more important to talk about? pa Ti e n T: Oh, the exam. Julia’s not that important. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, so you were saying that it’s generally hard for you to get to work at the library? 112 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND You steer patients away from peripheral issues that were not on the original agenda, and which hold little promise for helping them prog -ress during the session. A notable exception occurs when you deliber -ately (though usually briefly) engage patients in more casual conversa -tion to achieve a specific goal. For example, you might ask about their family, movies, or social events they have recently attended to brighten their mood, facilitate the alliance, or assess their cognitive functioning or social skills. THE m IDD l E PART O f THE S ESSIONNext you will list the names of the problems on the prioritized agenda and ask patients which problem they want to work on first. Doing so affords them the opportunity to be active and take responsibility. At times, though, you may take the lead in suggesting an agenda item with which to start, especially when you judge that a particular problem is the most important. (“Is it okay with you if we start with the problem of finding a part-time job? ”)You will collect data about the problem, conceptualize the patients’ difficulties according to the cognitive model, and collaboratively decide on which part of the cognitive model you will begin working (solving the problem situation, evaluating automatic thoughts, reducing patients’ immediate distress (if the patients’ affect is so high they cannot focus on problem solving, evaluating thoughts, or behavioral change), sug -gesting behavioral changes (and teaching behavioral skills if needed), or decreasing patients’ physiological arousal (if it is interfering with an important discussion). In the context of discussing problems on the agenda, you will be teaching patients skills and setting new homework. You will also make periodic summaries, if needed, to help you and the patient recall what you have been doing in this part of the session. In discussing the first problem (and subsequent problems), you will interweave your therapy goals as appropriate. In this second session, I seek not only to help Sally do some problem solving, but also to:Reinforce the cognitive model. • Continue teaching Sally to identify her automatic thoughts. • Provide some symptom relief through helping Sally • respond to her anxious thoughts. As always, maintain and build rapport through accurate • understanding. Structure and Format 113 Agenda Item No. 1 Th e r a p i s T: Okay, let’s take a look at the agenda. Where do you think we should start? We could talk about your exam, your mood when you’re studying or when you’re in the library, or the course of improvement. pa Ti e n T: My economics exam, I guess, I’m really worried about it. Th e r a p i s T: [collecting data] Okay, can you give me an overview of what happened this week? How much did you study? What hap -pened with your concentration? pa Ti e n T: Well, I meant to study all the time. But every time I sat down, I just got so nervous. Sometimes I didn’t realize that my mind had wandered, and I had to keep rereading the same page. Th e r a p i s T: [continuing to collect data so I can help problem-solve and identify possible distortions in Sally’s thinking] When is the exam, and how many chapters does it cover? pa Ti e n T: It’s in 2 weeks, and I think it covers the first five chapters. Th e r a p i s T: And how many chapters have you read at least once? pa Ti e n T: About three. Th e r a p i s T: And there are still some things in these first three chapters that you don’t understand? pa Ti e n T: A lot of things. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. So, in a nutshell, you have an exam in 2 weeks, and you’re worried that you won’t understand the material well enough? pa Ti e n T: Right. In this first part, I seek an overview of the problem. I subtly model how to express this problem succinctly. Next, I help Sally identify her auto -matic thoughts by having her recall a specific situation. Th e r a p i s T: Can you remember a time this week when you thought about studying or tried to study, and the anxiety got really bad? pa Ti e n T: Yes, sure . . . last night. Th e r a p i s T: What time was it? Where were you? pa Ti e n T: It was about 7:30. I was walking to the library. Th e r a p i s T: Can you picture it in your head now? It’s 7:30, you’re walk -ing to the library. . . . What goes through your mind? pa Ti e n T: What if I flunk the exam? What if I flunk the course? How will I ever make it through the semester? 114 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Okay, so you were able to identify your automatic thoughts. And how did these thoughts make you feel? Anxious? pa Ti e n T: Very. Th e r a p i s T: Let me tell you a little more about these automatic thoughts. We call them automatic because they seem just to pop into your mind. Most of the time, you’re probably not even aware of them; you’re probably much more aware of how you’re feeling emotion -ally. Even if you are aware of them, you probably don’t think to evaluate how accurate your thoughts are. You just accept them as true. pa Ti e n T: Hmmm. Th e r a p i s T: What you’ll learn to do here in therapy is first to identify your thoughts, and then judge for yourself whether they’re com -pletely true, partially true, or not true at all. ( pause ) Can we look at the first thought together? [starting the process of evaluating the automatic thought] What evidence do you have that you’ll flunk the exam? pa Ti e n T: Well, I don’t understand everything. Th e r a p i s T: Anything else? pa Ti e n T: No . . . just that I’m running out of time. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. Any evidence that you might not flunk? pa Ti e n T: Well, I did do okay on the first quiz. Th e r a p i s T: Anything else? pa Ti e n T: I guess I understand the first two chapters better than the third one. The third one is the one I’m really having trouble with. Th e r a p i s T: [starting problem solving; having Sally take the lead] What could you do to learn the third chapter better? pa Ti e n T: I could read it again. I could look through my lecture notes. Th e r a p i s T: Anything else? pa Ti e n T: (Hesitates . ) I can’t think of anything. Th e r a p i s T: Anyone else you could ask for help? pa Ti e n T: Well, I suppose I could ask Sean; he’s the teaching assistant. Or maybe Ross, the guy down the hall who took this course last year. Th e r a p i s T: That sounds good. Did you think of asking either of them for help this week? Did any automatic thoughts get in the way? pa Ti e n T: No, I guess I just didn’t even think of it. Structure and Format 115 Th e r a p i s T: Whom do you think would be better to ask? pa Ti e n T: Sean, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: How likely are you to ask him? pa Ti e n T: I will. He has office hours tomorrow morning. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, assuming you get help this week, what do you think of your prediction that you might flunk? pa Ti e n T: Well, I guess I do know some of the stuff. Maybe I could get help with the rest. Th e r a p i s T: And how do you feel now? pa Ti e n T: A little less worried, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, to summarize, you had a lot of automatic thoughts this week that made you feel anxious. But when you stop to evaluate these thoughts, it seems likely that there are some things you can do to pass. When you really look at the evidence and answer the thoughts, you feel better . . . Is that right? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, that’s true. Th e r a p i s T: For homework this week, I’d like you to look for these auto -matic thoughts again when you notice your mood changing. These thoughts may have a grain of truth, but often I think you’ll find that they’re not necessarily completely true. Next week we’ll look for evidence together to figure out whether the thoughts you wrote down for homework are completely accurate. Okay? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: Now, identifying and evaluating thoughts is a skill for you to learn, like learning to drive or type. You may not be very good at it at first, but with practice you’ll get better and better. And I’ll teach you more about this in future sessions. See what you can do this week just to identify some thoughts, but don’t expect yourself to be good at it yet. Okay? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: One more word about this. When you write down some thoughts this week, remind yourself again that the thoughts may or may not be true . Otherwise, writing them down before you’ve learned to evaluate them could make you feel a little worse. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: Let’s write this assignment down. And while we’re at it, let’s see if there’s anything else you want to do to get ready for the test. [See Figure 7. 3. ] 116 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND In this section, I accomplish many things at once. I address a prob -lem from the agenda that is of concern to Sally; I teach her more about automatic thoughts; I help her identify, evaluate, and respond to a specific distressing thought; I facilitate symptom relief by decreasing her anxiety; and I set up a homework assignment and advise Sally to have realistic expectations about learning the new skill. Chapters 9–12 describe in greater detail the process of teaching patients to identify and evaluate their automatic thoughts. Q: What if . . . I don’t know how to help patients solve a particular problem? A: There are several things you can do:Find out how they have already tried to solve the problem and • why it didn’t work. You may be able to modify the solution or modify thoughts that got in the way of the solution working. Use yourself as a model. Ask yourself, “If I had this problem, • what would I do? ”Ask the patient to name another person (usually a friend or • family member) who could conceivably have the same kind of problem. What advice would the patient give him or her? See whether that advice could apply to the patient. Jan. 29 Read this list twice a day 1. When I notice my mood changing, ask myself, “What’s going through my mind right now? ” and jot down my automatic thoughts (which may or may not be completely true). Try to do this at least once a day. 2. If I can’t figure out my automatic thoughts, jot down just the situation. Remember, learning to identify my thinking is a skill I’ll get better at, like typing. 3. Ask Sean for help with Chapter 3 of Econ book. 4. Read over therapy notes. 5. Continue running/swimming. 6. Plan 3 social activities. 7. Daily: Add to credit list FIGURE 7. 3. Sally’s homework (Session 2). Structure and Format 117 If • you’re stuck, postpone the discussion: “I’d like to think more about the problem this week. Could we put it on the agenda to talk more about next week? ” Also, see pages 256–258 for a further description of problem solv -ing. Agenda Item No. 2 In the next section of the therapy session, I provide Sally with some information about the course of improvement. Having just finished a segment of the session, I briefly summarize first:Th e r a p i s T: Okay, we just finished talking about your exam and how your automatic thoughts really made you feel anxious and inter -fered with problem solving. Next, I’d like to talk about the course of getting better, if that’s okay. pa Ti e n T: Sure. Th e r a p i s T: I’m glad you’re feeling a little less depressed today, and I hope you continue to feel better. But probably you won’t just feel a little bit better every single week until you’re back to your old self. You should expect to have your ups and downs. Now I’m telling you this for a reason. Can you imagine what you might think if you expected to keep feeling better and better and then one day you felt a lot worse? pa Ti e n T: I’d probably think I would never get better. Th e r a p i s T: That’s right. So I want you to remember that we predicted a possible setback, that setbacks are a normal part of getting better. Do you want to get down something in writing about that? See Chapter 18 for a more extensive discussion of relapse prevention and a pictorial representation of the normal course of therapy. Periodic Summaries Three kinds of summarizing are important throughout sessions. The first summarizes content. Patients often describe a problem with many details. You will summarize what they have said in the form of the cog -nitive model to ensure that you have correctly identified what is most troublesome to patients, and to present it in a way that is more concise and clear. You use patients’ own words as much as possible, both to convey accurate understanding and to keep the key difficulty activated in their mind: 118 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Let me make sure I understand. You were considering get -ting a part-time job again, but then you thought, “I’ll never be able to handle it, ” and the thought made you so sad that you turned off your computer and went back to bed and cried for half an hour. Is that right? Had I paraphrased the patient’s ideas and failed to use her own words (“Sounds like you weren’t sure if you could do well if you got a part-time job”), I might have lessened the intensity of the automatic thought and emotion, and our subsequent evaluation of the thought might then have been less effective. Summaries that substitute the therapist’s words may also lead to patients’ believing that they have not been accurately understood:pa Ti e n T: No, it’s not that I thought I might not do well; I’m afraid I might not be able to handle it at all . You will often ask patients to make a second kind of summary after you have evaluated an automatic thought or belief:“Can you summarize what we just talked about? ”Or“What do you think the main message is here? ”Or“What do you think would be important for you to remember? ”If patients do a good job of summarizing, you or they should write down this summary so they can read it for homework. If their summary misses the mark, you might say, “Well, that’s close, but I wonder if it would be more helpful if you remembered it this way . . . ” If the patient agrees, the latter summary is recorded in their notes. The third is a brief summary when a section of a session has been completed, so both therapist and patient have a clear understanding of what they have just accomplished and what they will do next:Th e r a p i s T: Okay, so we’ve finished talking about the course of treat -ment. Next, should we talk about the problem with your cousin? f INA l SUmm ARY AND f EEDBAC k The goal of the final summary is to focus the patient’s attention on the most important points of the session in a positive way. In early sessions, you will generally summarize. Structure and Format 119 Th e r a p i s T: Well, we have just a few minutes left. Let me summarize what we covered today, and then I’ll ask you for your reaction to the session. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: It sounds like when you had more hopeful thoughts this week, you felt less depressed. But then your anxiety increased because you had all these negative thoughts about your exam. When we looked at the evidence that you’ll flunk, though, it seemed unconvincing. And you came up with a couple of good strategies to help your studying, some of which you’ll try between now and our next session. We also discussed what you should remind yourself if you have a setback. Finally, we talked about having you continue to go running. And we went over identifying and evaluating your automatic thoughts, which is a skill we’ll keep practicing in therapy. (pause ) Do you think that about covers it? pa Ti e n T: Yes. As the patient progresses, the therapist may ask the patient to sum -marize the most important points. Summarizing is much more easily accomplished if the patient has taken good notes during the session:Th e r a p i s T: Okay, Sally, we just have a few minutes left. What do you think is going to be most important for you to remember this week? You can look at your notes. Following the final summary, the therapist elicits feedback about the session from the patient. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, Sally, what did you think about the session today? Was there anything I said that bothered you? Anything you think I got wrong? pa Ti e n T: I am a little bit worried that I could have a setback. Th e r a p i s T: Well, a setback is possible, and if you do find yourself feel -ing significantly worse before our next session, I’d like you to call me and we can discuss whether you should come in sooner. On the other hand, you may very well have another better week. pa Ti e n T: I hope so. Th e r a p i s T: Should we put the topic “setbacks” on the agenda again next week? pa Ti e n T: Yes, I think so. 120 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Anything else about the session? Anything you want us to do differently next time? pa Ti e n T: No, I don’t think so. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. See you next week. If you sense that patients have not fully expressed their reaction to the session, you may ask them to complete a therapy report (see Figure 5. 2). When patients do express negative feedback, you will positively reinforce them and then try to solve the problem. If there is insufficient time to do so, you may apologize and tell patients that you would like to discuss their negative reaction at the very beginning of the following session. Negative feedback usually indicates difficulty in the therapeu -tic alliance (discussed more fully in J. S. Beck, 2005). SESSION 3 AND B EYONDLater therapy sessions maintain the same basic format. The content var -ies according to the patient’s problems and goals, and your therapeutic goals. In this section, I outline the flow of therapy across sessions. A more detailed description of treatment planning can be found in Chapter 19. As mentioned previously, you initially take the lead in helping patients identify and modify automatic thoughts, devising homework assignments, and summarizing the session. As therapy progresses, there is a gradual shift in responsibility. Toward the end of therapy, patients themselves tend to identify their distorted thinking, devise their own homework assignments, and summarize the session. Another gradual shift is from an emphasis on automatic thoughts to a focus on both automatic thoughts and underlying beliefs (see Chap -ters 13 and 14). As therapy moves into the final phase, there is another shift: preparing the patient for termination and relapse prevention (see Chapter 18). When planning an individual session, you are mindful of the stage of therapy and you continue to use your conceptualization of the patient to guide treatment, noting potential agenda items before a session. As patients report on their mood, briefly review the week, and specify agenda topics, you formulate in your own mind a specific goal or goals for the session. For example, in Session 3, my goals for Sally (though not necessarily for all depressed patients) are to begin teaching her in a structured way to evaluate her automatic thoughts and to continue to schedule pleasurable activities. In Session 4, I aim to help Sally do some problem solving about finding a part-time job and continue to respond to her dysfunctional thoughts. I continually Structure and Format 121 seek to integrate my goals with Sally’s agenda items. Thus I teach her problem-solving and cognitive restructuring skills in the context of situ -ations she brings to therapy. This combination of solving problems and helping patients respond to their thoughts generally allows the novice therapist sufficient time to discuss in depth only about two problematic situations from the agenda during a given therapy session. Experienced therapists can often cover more. To refine your conceptualization, to keep track of what is being covered in a therapy session, and to plan future sessions, you take notes during the session (see Figure 7. 4) and keep a copy of notes the patient takes. It is useful to note the problem(s) discussed, dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs written verbatim (and the degree to which the patient initially believed them), interventions made in session, newly restructured thoughts and beliefs (and the degree of belief in them), the assigned homework, and topics for the agendas of future sessions. Even experienced therapists have difficulty remembering all these important items without written notes. FIGURE 7. 4. Therapy notes.

It is important at times, especially when patients are revealing emotion -ally painful material, not to take notes so you can be more fully present with the patient. This chapter outlined the structure and format of a typical early therapy session and briefly described therapy across sessions. The fol -lowing chapter discusses problems in following the prescribed format, while Chapter 19 describes in detail how to plan treatment before indi -vidual sessions, within sessions, and across sessions. 3.

(cont. ) 123 Chapter 8 PROBl Em S WITH STRUCTURING THE THERAPY SESSIONProblems invariably arise in structuring sessions. When you become aware of a problem, you will specify it, conceptualize why the prob-lem arose, and devise a solution. If you have correctly diagnosed the patient and developed a sound treatment plan but still have diffi culties in structuring sessions, you should check on the following:Have you failed to gently interrupt the patient to direct the session? • Have you failed to socialize the patient into treatment? • Have you failed to suffi ciently engage the patient in treatment or to • develop a strong therapeutic alliance? These diffi culties are described in this chapter. Then problems and remedies for each segment of a typical session are offered. THERAPIST COGNITIONSIf you are a novice therapist or a therapist experienced in a less direc-tive modality, you may have interfering cognitions about structure, interrupting patients, and implementing the standard structure. 124 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Automatic Thoughts“I can’t structure the session. ”“[my patient] won’t like the structure. ”“She can’t express herself succinctly. ”“He’ll get mad if I’m too directive. ”“I shouldn’t interrupt her. ”“He won’t do homework. ”“She’ll feel invalidated if I evaluate her thinking. ”You should monitor your own level of discomfort and identify your automatic thoughts during and between sessions. You can then identify a problem, evaluate and respond to your thoughts, and problem-solve to make it easier for you to experiment with implementing the standard structure at the next session. INTERRUPTING THE P ATIENTTo structure sessions effectively so therapy can proceed most efficiently, you need to use gentle interruption. In the following transcript, the therapist finds himself feeling slightly overwhelmed by the patient’s out -pouring of problems. He uses his own emotional reaction as a cue to interrupt and structure the patient. pa Ti e n T: And then, I couldn’t believe it, but my sister told me—told me! —that I had to go help out Mom. She knows that I can’t do that. I mean, my mother and I have never gotten along. If I go over, she’ll just bombard me with stuff to do. And she’ll criticize me. I just can’t take any more criticism. I get it all day at work and . . . Th e r a p i s T: Can I interrupt you for a minute? I want to make sure I get what’s been going on. We started talking about holiday plans and what you should do and then you described a few more problems. Which do you think would be most important to work on? Holiday plans, your sister, mom, or work? Q: What if . . . patients get upset when you interrupt? A: If they do not spontaneously tell you that your interruptions were distressing, ask them what was just going through their minds when you notice a negative affect shift. If they fail to identify their Problems with Structuring the Session 125 automatic thoughts, you can offer your hypothesis: “I was won -dering whether you thought I was interrupting you too much? ” Once you ascertain that interrupting has been a problem, posi -tively reinforce them: “It’s good you told me that. ” Next, apolo -gize; simply say, “I’m sorry. ” (An apology is in order because you have apparently misgauged how much interruption they could tolerate. ) Then solve the problem, for example, by asking patients if they would like to talk without interruption for the next 5 or 10 minutes, at the end of which time you will summarize what they said, “Because it’s important to me that I really understand what’s going on with you. ”SOCIA l Iz ING THE P ATIENTA second common difficulty in maintaining the prescribed structure can arise if you do not adequately socialize patients. Patients who are new to cognitive behavior therapy do not know in advance that you would like them to report on the week, describe their mood, and set the agenda in a succinct way. They do not know that you will ask them to summarize discussions of important problems, provide feedback, remember session content, and consistently do daily homework. In addition, you are essentially teaching patients certain skills and also a new way of relating to you (for those who have been in another type of therapy), or a new way of relating to their difficulties so that they can adopt a more objective, problem-solving orientation. Therefore, you must often describe, provide a rationale, and monitor with gentle, cor -rective feedback each of the session elements. ENGAGING THE P ATIENTA third common difficulty arises when patients have dysfunctional beliefs that interfere with their ability to commit to working in treat -ment. They may not have clear goals (described in Chapter 5) that they really want to achieve. They may have unrealistic hopes that they will somehow get better without doing the work of therapy. They may feel hopeless about their ability to solve problems, affect their life, or change. They may even fear that if they get better, their life will get worse in some way (e. g. , they will lose you as a therapist, or have to return to work). You need to be alert for the possibility of these kinds of interfering cognitions and help patients respond to them so they will be more amenable to the structure and tasks of treatment. 126 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND STRENGTHENING THE T HERAPEUTIC All IANCEA fourth common difficulty involves patients’ unwillingness to con -form to the prescribed structure because of their perceptions of and dysfunctional beliefs about themselves, about therapy, or about you. If you believe it will not interfere with the alliance, you may acknowledge patients’ discomfort, but encourage them to comply as an experiment. At the other end of the spectrum, you may allow the patient to domi -nate and control the flow of the session—initially. With most patients, however, you will negotiate a compromise satisfactory to both of you, and you will try, over time, to move the patient toward the standard structure. How do you determine whether the difficulty in adherence to ses -sion structure is due to faulty socialization or reluctance in comply -ing? You first intervene by further socializing patients to the cognitive behavior therapy model and by monitoring their verbal and nonverbal responses. If it is simply a problem in socialization, patients’ responses are fairly neutral (or perhaps slightly self-critical), and subsequent com -pliance is good. Th e r a p i s T: Can I interrupt for a moment? Can we get back to what happened when you called your friend? pa Ti e n T: Oh, sure. When patients react negatively, they have undoubtedly perceived your request in a negative way, and you need to switch gears. pa Ti e n T: (irritably ) But this thing with my mother is really upsetting. Th e r a p i s T: Oh, should we spend a few minutes on your mom, then? We may not have time, though, to get back to talking about David. Is that okay? Problems can also arise if you impose structure in a controlling or demanding fashion. If patients are reluctant to provide you with honest feedback about how overbearing you are, you may not know you have made this mistake. It will be important for you to review a record -ing of the session, or better yet, have a peer, colleague, or supervisor review it. Then you can model apologizing, and remedy the problem at the next session: “I think I came across as too heavy-handed last week. I’m sorry, I do want to make sure that you agree with how the session goes. ”Typical problems with each stage of the therapy session, excluding significant mistakes therapists make, are presented below. Problems with Structuring the Session 127 m OOD C HEC k Common problems involve patients’ failure to fill out forms, annoy -ance with forms, or difficulty in subjectively expressing (in a concise manner) their general mood during the week. If the difficulty is sim -ply faulty socialization relating to completing the forms, you can ask patients whether they remember and agree with the rationale for fill -ing them out, and determine whether there’s a practical difficulty that needs to be resolved (e. g. , insufficient time, forgetting, or a problem in literacy). When patients are annoyed by the request to fill out the forms, you can ask for their automatic thoughts when thinking about or actually filling them out, or you can ask for the significance of the situation: “What’s the worst part about them? ” Or “What does it mean that I’ve asked you to fill out these forms? ” You can then empathically respond to patients’ concerns, help them evaluate relevant thoughts and beliefs, and/or do problem solving. These responses are provided in the three examples below. pa Ti e n T: These forms don’t really seem to apply to me. Half of the questions are irrelevant. Th e r a p i s T: Yes, I know. But actually they’re helpful to me—I can look at them quickly and get the overall picture, and not bother you with dozens of questions. Would you be willing to fill them out again next week, and we can talk more about them then if they still bother you? In the next example, the patient clearly expresses his annoyance through his choice of words, tone of voice, and body language. pa Ti e n T: These forms are a waste of time. Half the questions are irrel -evant. Th e r a p i s T: What’s the worst part about filling them out? pa Ti e n T: I’m busy. I have a lot to do. If my life fills up with meaningless tasks, I’ll never get anything done. Th e r a p i s T: I can see you feel pretty irritated. How long does it take to fill out these forms? pa Ti e n T: . . . I don’t know. A few minutes, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: I know some of the items don’t apply, but actually they save us time in the therapy session because I don’t have to ask you lots of questions myself. Could we try to problem-solve and see where you could fit in the time to do them? 128 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: I guess it’s not that big a deal. I’ll do them. I’ll just leave work a little earlier next time. Here I avoided directly evaluating the accuracy of the patient’s automatic thoughts, because he is annoyed and I sense that he will per -ceive such questioning in a negative way. Instead I provide a rationale and help the patient realize that the task is not as time consuming as he has perceived it to be. In a third case, I judge that further persuasion to fill out forms will negatively affect a tenuous therapeutic alliance. pa Ti e n T: (in an angry voice ) I hate these forms. They don’t apply to me. I know you want me to fill them out, but I’m telling you, they’re worthless. Th e r a p i s T: Let’s skip them, then, at least for the time being. I would like to get a clear idea of how you’ve been feeling during the week, though. Maybe you could just rate your emotions on a 0 to 100 or 0 to 10 scale. A different problem involves patients’ difficulty in subjectively expressing their mood, either because they do not do so concisely, or because they have difficulty labeling their moods. You might gently interrupt, and either ask specific questions or demonstrate to them how to respond. Th e r a p i s T: Can I interrupt for a moment? Can you tell me in just a sentence how your mood has been this week as compared to last week? I do want to hear more about the problem with your brother in a few minutes, but first I just need to know whether you’ve gener -ally felt better, worse, or the same compared to last week. pa Ti e n T: A little worse, I think. Th e r a p i s T: More anxious? More sad? More angry? pa Ti e n T: Maybe a little more anxious. About the same amount of sad. Not angry really. When patients have difficulty labeling their moods, you might respond differently:Th e r a p i s T: It sounds like it’s hard to pin down how you’ve been feel -ing. Maybe we should put on the agenda “identifying feelings. ”During the session, you might use the techniques described in Chapter 10 to teach patients to specify their mood. Problems with Structuring the Session 129 BRIEf UPDATEA common difficulty arises when patients provide too detailed an account of or unfocused rambling about their week. After several such sentences, you should gently jump in:Th e r a p i s T: Can I interrupt you for a moment? Right now, I just need to get the big picture of how you’ve been feeling. Could you just tell me about your week in two or three sentences? Was it generally a good week? A bad week? Or did it have its ups and downs? If patients continue to offer details instead of the broader picture, you might demonstrate what you are looking for:Th e r a p i s T: It sounds to me like you’re saying, “I had a pretty hard week. I had a fight with a friend, and I was really anxious about going out, and I had trouble concentrating on my work. ” Is that right? Some patients do understand and are capable of providing a con -cise review, but do not choose to do so. If you have data to suggest that questioning patients about their reluctance to comply could damage the alliance, you may initially allow them to control the update por -tion of the session. (Such data might include patients’ verbal and/or nonverbal reactions to your prior attempts at structuring, their direct statements of strong preferences in the therapeutic process, or their reports of a strong reaction in the past when they have perceived others as controlling or dominating. )Extreme reactions to structuring are not common, however. Usu -ally you can matter-of-factly elicit reasons for patients’ reluctance, and then problem-solve. After asking patients to review their week more concisely and noting a negative shift in affect, you might ask, “When I just asked you to give me the big picture, what went through your mind? ” Having identified patients’ automatic thoughts, you might then (1) help them evaluate the validity of their thoughts, (2) use the down -ward arrow technique (see pages 206–208) to uncover the meaning of their thoughts, and/or (3) make an empathic statement and move straight to problem solving, as below:Th e r a p i s T: I’m sorry you felt I cut you off again. I can see you have a lot on your mind, and I would like to hear it. Do you want to continue with the update now, or should we put “update of week” on the agenda? I just want to make sure I know all the problems you want to talk about today. 130 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND This latter choice is usually better than helping patients evalu -ate their thoughts at the moment if they are particularly annoyed. By expressing your concern and willingness to compromise, you can often modify patients’ perception that you are being too controlling. BRIDGE BETWEEN S ESSIONSA problem arises when patients provide too much or too little informa -tion. For example, when asked to relate important events in the preced -ing week, patients can give too detailed an account, necessitating gentle interruption by the therapist. Or they may shrug or say that they cannot think of anything, and you either need to ask a more pointed question (“What happened when you went to see the professor? ”) or return to this question a little later on, if you have not collected the data you need. Patients may also have difficulty recalling the important points from the previous session, particularly if you neglected to send them home with therapy notes, or if they failed to read their notes for homework. Typical difficulties in setting the agenda arise when patients fail to contribute to the agenda, ramble when setting the agenda, or are hope -less about discussing problems on the agenda. Patients who fail to con -tribute to the agenda may be inadequately socialized (or too confused to name specific problems), or they may put a special negative meaning on contributing. These two cases are illustrated below. Th e r a p i s T: What problem or problems do you want my help in solving today? pa Ti e n T: . . . I don’t know. Th e r a p i s T: What problems came up for you this past week? Or what problems do you expect might come up this week? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. Things are status quo, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: When did you feel worst this week? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks . ) I don’t know. The whole week was terrible. Th e r a p i s T: Do you think you felt worst during the day, when you were at work? Or in the evenings? pa Ti e n T: In the evenings, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, can we put “evenings” on the agenda to see if there’s anything we can do to make them a little better? pa Ti e n T: All right. At the end of the session, I will ask the patient to add a homework assignment to his list, to think about what problems he wants help in Problems with Structuring the Session 131 solving at the next session. If he fails to contribute to the agenda the fol -lowing week, even in the face of an update that suggests he did experi -ence some difficulties, I might elicit his automatic thoughts about and/or the meaning of my request. Th e r a p i s T: Were you able to think about problems you want help with? pa Ti e n T: (in a slightly annoyed tone ) I thought about it. But I didn’t come up with anything. Th e r a p i s T: How were you feeling when you were thinking about it? Annoyed? pa Ti e n T: Maybe a little. Th e r a p i s T: What was going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I’m just not sure that this therapy is right for me. Th e r a p i s T: It’s good you told me that. Do you have a sense of what might help you more? pa Ti e n T: My last therapist just let me talk about whatever I wanted. He didn’t make me decide at the beginning. Th e r a p i s T: So when I ask you to name problems you want help with, do you feel kind of hemmed in? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, I guess it does. Th e r a p i s T: So let’s figure out together how to make it better. Would you like to skip setting the agenda at the very beginning of our ses -sions? How would it be if you came in and talked about whatever you want for the first 10 minutes? Then I’d like to summarize what you said so I can make sure I really understood you. Then maybe we could pick something out from what you’ve said to focus on for the next part of the session. ( pause ) How does that sound? pa Ti e n T: It sounds better. Th e r a p i s T: Is there anything else that bothers you about this ther -apy? pa Ti e n T: No, I don’t think so. Th e r a p i s T: Could you be sure to let me know if you think of some -thing? pa Ti e n T: Okay. This patient’s response was unusual. Most patients are much more eas -ily socialized into agenda setting. But in this case, I recognized that pushing the patient further might alienate him, so I demonstrated my desire to collaboratively “fix” the problem. He needed more flexibility 132 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND in session structure initially, but I moved him toward a more standard structure as soon as I could. Patients who ramble during agenda setting or launch into a detailed account of a problem instead of naming it usually just require further instruction. Th e r a p i s T: (gently interrupting ) Can I interrupt you for a moment? Should we call this “problem with boss”? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Can you tell me the name of any other problem you’d like my help in solving? Patients who persist in the next session in describing problems rather than just naming them during agenda setting can be asked to jot down their agenda topics for homework (see Figure 7. 1, page 102). A third problem in agenda setting arises when patients feel hope -less about discussing their problems. Here I try to get the patient into a problem-solving mode. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. So on the agenda so far, we’ve got the problems of tiredness, organizing your finances, and balancing your check -book. Anything else? pa Ti e n T: (sighs) No . . . Yes . . . I don’t know . . . I’m so overwhelmed. I don’t think any of this is going to help. Th e r a p i s T: You don’t think talking about your problems in here will help? pa Ti e n T: No. What’s the use? I mean, you can’t fix the fact that I owe too much money and I’m so tired I can’t even get out of bed most mornings—not to mention the fact that I’m making so many mis -takes at work that I’ll probably get fired. Th e r a p i s T: Well, it’s true that we can’t fix everything at once. And you do have real problems that we need to work on together. Now, if we just have time to work on one thing today, which do you think will help more than the others? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know . . . the tiredness, maybe. If I could sleep better, maybe I could get more done. In this case, I give the patient the message that his problems are real, that they can be worked on one by one, and that he need not work on them alone. Asking him to make a forced choice does help him focus on selecting a problem, and seems to help him get oriented toward prob - Problems with Structuring the Session 133 lem solving. Had the patient refused to make a choice, I might have tried a different tactic:Th e r a p i s T: It sounds like you’re feeling pretty hopeless. I don’t know for sure that working together we can make a difference, but I’d like to try. Would you be willing to try? Could we talk about the tiredness for a few minutes and see what happens? Acknowledging his hopelessness and my inability to guarantee success increased the patient’s willingness to experiment with problem solv -ing. REVIEW O f HOm EWOR k A typical problem arises when therapists, in their haste to get to patients’ agenda issues, fail to ask patients about the homework they did over the past week. You are more likely to remember to ask about homework if you keep it as a standard agenda item and if you review your therapy notes from the previous session before patients enter your office. The opposite problem sometimes arises when the therapist reviews home -work (unrelated to the patient’s distress that day) in too much detail before turning to the patient’s agenda topics. Other homework prob -lems are discussed in detail in Chapter 17. DISCUSSION O f AGENDA I TEm STypical problems here include hopelessness, unfocused or tangential discussion, inefficient pacing, and the failure to make a therapeutic intervention. Unfocused discussion usually results when you fail to struc -ture the discussion appropriately through gentle interruptions (guid -ing the patient back to the issue at hand); when you fail to emphasize key automatic thoughts, emotions, beliefs, and behaviors; and when you fail to summarize frequently. In the following transcript, I summarize several minutes of the patient’s description in just a few words and redi -rect the patient to identify her automatic thoughts. Th e r a p i s T: Let me just make sure I understand. You had a fight with your sister yesterday. This reminded you of previous fights, and you began to get more and more angry. Last night you called her again, and she began to criticize you for not helping out with your mother. Is that right? 134 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: What went through your mind as she said, “You’re the black sheep of the family”? Pacing is often a problem when you overestimate how many issues can be discussed during one therapy session. It is preferable to priori -tize and then to specify two problems (or possibly a third) to be dis -cussed during a session, especially if you are a novice cognitive behavior therapist. Together you and the patient should keep track of the time, and collaboratively decide what to do if time is running short. In practi -cal terms, it is advisable to have two clocks (one for each of you to eas -ily see) so you can encourage patients to monitor the passage of time along with you:Th e r a p i s T: We only have 10 minutes left before we have to start finish -ing up the session. Would you like to continue talking about this problem with your neighbor, or finish up in the next minute or two so we have time to discuss the problem with your coworker? A third problem with discussion of problems is the therapist’s failure to make a therapeutic intervention . Much of the time, merely describing a problem or identifying dysfunctional thoughts or beliefs related to the problem will not result in the patient’s feeling better. You should be con -scious of your goal to help patients (during the session itself) respond to their dysfunctional cognitions, solve or partially solve a problem, and set up homework assignments designed to ameliorate the problem or help them feel less distressed. Throughout the session, you should ask yourself:“How can I help the patient feel better by the end of the session? ”“How can I help the patient have a better week? ”SETTING N EW H Om EWOR k Patients are less likely to do homework when the therapist:Suggests an assignment that is too difficult or is unrelated to the • patient’s concerns. fails to provide a good rationale. • Problems with Structuring the Session 135 forgets to review homework assigned during previous sessions. • Does not stress the importance of daily homework in general and • of specific assignments. Does not explicitly teach the patient how to do the assignment. • Does not start the assignment in session, do covert rehearsal • (pages 303–305), or ask standard questions about potential obstacles that might get in the way. Does not have the patient write down the homework assignment. • Noncollaboratively sets a homework assignment that the patient • does not want to do. If none of the above is true, you will try to ascertain whether patients hold dysfunctional beliefs about homework (e. g. , “I should feel better without working hard”; “My therapist should cure me without my having to change things”; “I’m too incompetent to do homework”; “Homework is trivial and won’t get me better”). You then help patients specify and test their dysfunctional ideas about homework. Homework is discussed more extensively in Chapter 17. f INA l SUmm ARYYou will periodically make summaries throughout the session to make sure you understand what patients have been expressing. If you have followed standard procedure and you have made sure the important points of the session are recorded as you go along, then the end sum -mary can consist of a quick review of these notes and a verbal summary of any other topics that were discussed and of the homework assign -ments. Without therapy notes to refer to, patients usually experience difficulty summarizing the session and remembering the important conclusions they drew. f EEDBAC k Problems arise when patients are distressed at the end of a session and you have not left sufficient time to resolve their distress, or when patients are upset but fail to relate their distress to you. A practical solution to avoid running out of time is to start closing down the ses -sion 5–10 minutes before the end. You can then more effectively review homework already assigned, discuss whether any other assignments 136 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND might be helpful, summarize the session or ask patients to do so, and elicit and respond to feedback. A sample response to negative feedback follows:Th e r a p i s T: What did you think about today’s session? Was there any -thing I got wrong? Or did I say anything that bothered you? pa Ti e n T: I don’t think you realize how hard it is for me to get things done. I have so many responsibilities and so many problems. It’s easy for you to say I should just concentrate on my work and forget all about what’s happening with my boss. Th e r a p i s T: Oh, it’s good you told me—and I’m sorry you got that impression. What I meant to get across was that I realize you are very distressed by the problem with your boss. I wish we had time to talk about that problem now. ( pause ) But meanwhile, was there something I said or did that made you think I was suggesting that you just forget all about the problem with your boss? Next, I clarified the misunderstanding, and we agreed to put the prob -lem on the agenda at our next session. Therapists at all levels of experience encounter difficulties in struc -turing with particular patients. Careful review of your session tapes can be invaluable in identifying and then solving these problems. A more extensive account of how to conceptualize and modify problems patients present in session can be found in J. S. Beck (2005). 137 Chapter 9 IDENTIf YING AUTOm ATIC THOUGHTSThe cognitive model states that the interpretation of a situation (rather than the situation itself), often expressed in automatic thoughts, infl uences one’s subsequent emotion, behavior, and physio-logical response. Of course, certain events are almost universally upset-ting: for example, a personal assault or rejection. People with psycho-logical disorders, however, often misconstrue neutral or even positive situations, and thus their automatic thoughts are biased. By critically examining their thoughts and correcting thinking errors, they often feel better. This chapter describes the characteristics of automatic thoughts. Then it describes how to:Explain automatic thoughts to patients. • Elicit and specify automatic thoughts. • Teach patients to identify automatic thoughts. • CHARACTERISTICS Of AUTOm ATIC THOUGHTSAutomatic thoughts are a stream of thinking that coexists with a more manifest stream of thought (Beck, 1964). These thoughts are not pecu- 138 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND liar to people with psychological distress; they are an experience com -mon to us all. Most of the time we are barely aware of these thoughts, although with just a little training we can easily bring these thoughts into consciousness. When we become aware of our thoughts, we may automatically do a reality check if we are not suffering from psychologi -cal dysfunction. A reader of this text, for example, while focusing on the content of this chapter, may have the automatic thought, “I don’t understand this, ” and feel slightly anxious. He may, however, spontaneously (i. e. , without conscious awareness) respond to the thought in a productive way: “I do understand some of it; let me just reread this section. ”This kind of automatic reality testing and responding to negative thoughts is a common experience. People who are in distress, however, may not engage in this kind of critical examination. Cognitive behavior therapy teaches them tools to evaluate their thoughts in a conscious, structured way, especially when they are upset. Sally, for example, when she is reading an Economics chapter, has the same thought as the reader above: “I don’t understand this. ” Her thinking becomes more extreme, however: “And I’ll never underst and it. ” She accepts these thoughts as correct and feels quite sad. After learning tools of cognitive behavior therapy, however, she is able to use her nega -tive emotion as a cue to look for, identify, and evaluate her thoughts, and develop an adaptive response: “Wait a minute, it’s not necessarily true that I’ll never understand this. I am having some trouble now. But if I reread it or come back to it when I’m fresher, I may understand it more. Anyway, understanding it isn’t crucial to my survival, and I can ask someone else to explain it to me if need be. ”Although automatic thoughts seem to pop up spontaneously, they become fairly predictable once the patient’s underlying beliefs are identified. You are concerned with identifying those thoughts that are dysfunctional—that is, those that distort reality, are emotionally dis -tressing, and/or interfere with patients’ ability to reach their goals. Dys -functional automatic thoughts are almost always negative unless the patient is manic or hypomanic, has a narcissistic personality, or is a substance abuser. Automatic thoughts are usually quite brief, and patients are often more aware of the emotion they feel as a result of their thoughts than of the thoughts themselves. Sitting in session, for example, patients may be somewhat aware of feeling anxious, sad, irritated, or embarrassed, but unaware of their automatic thoughts until their therapist questions them. The emotions patients feel are logically connected to the content of their automatic thoughts. For example, a patient thinks, “I’m such a dope. I don’t really understand what everyone [at the meeting] is Identifying Automatic Thoughts 139 saying, ” and feels sad. Another time he thinks, “She [my wife] doesn’t appreciate me, ” and feels angry. When he has the thoughts, “What if my loan doesn’t go through? What will I do next? ” the patient feels anxious. Automatic thoughts are often in “shorthand” form, but can be eas -ily spelled out when you ask for the meaning of the thought. For exam -ple, when a patient had the thought, “Oh, no! ” the meaning was, “[My boss] is going to give me too much work. ” “Damn! ” for another patient was the expression of the idea, “I was stupid to leave my cell phone at home. ”Automatic thoughts may be in verbal form, visual form (images), or both. In addition to his verbal automatic thought (“Oh, no! ”), the patient above had an image of himself, alone at his desk late at night, toiling over taxes (see Chapter 16 for a description of automatic thoughts in imaginal form). Automatic thoughts can be evaluated according to their validity and their utility . The most common type of automatic thought is dis -torted in some way and occurs despite objective evidence to the con -trary. A second type of automatic thought is accurate, but the conclusion the patient draws may be distorted. For example, “I didn’t do what I promised [a friend]” is a valid thought, but the conclusion, “Therefore I’m a bad person, ” is not. A third type of automatic thought is also valid, but decidedly dys -functional. For example, Sally was studying for an exam and thought, “It’s going to take me hours to finish this. I’ll be up until 3:00 A. M. ” This thought was undoubtedly accurate, but it increased her anxiety and decreased her concentration and motivation. A reasonable response to this thought would address its utility : “It’s true it will take a long time to finish this, but I can do it; I’ve done it before. Dwelling on how long it will take makes me feel miserable, and I won’t concentrate as well. It’ll probably take even longer to finish. It would be better to concentrate on finishing one part at a time and giving myself credit for having fin -ished it. ” Evaluating the validity and/or utility of automatic thoughts and adaptively responding to them generally produces a positive shift in affect. To summarize, automatic thoughts coexist with a more manifest stream of thoughts, arise spontaneously, and are not based on reflection or deliberation. People are usually more aware of the associated emo -tion but, with a little training, they can become aware of their thinking. The thoughts relevant to personal problems are associated with specific emotions, depending on their content and meaning. They are often brief and fleeting, in shorthand form, and may occur in verbal and/or imaginal form. People usually accept their automatic thoughts as true, without reflection or evaluation. Identifying, evaluating, and respond - 140 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND ing to automatic thoughts (in a more adaptive way) usually produces a positive shift in affect. Ex Pl AINING A UTO m ATIC T HOUGHTS TO P ATIENTSIt is desirable to explain automatic thoughts by using the patient’s own examples. In the context of discussing a specific problem with a patient, you will elicit the automatic thoughts associated with the problem. Th e r a p i s T: [moving to the first agenda topic] Should we talk about how upset you were at the park yesterday? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: How were you feeling emotionally: Sad? Anxious? Angry? pa Ti e n T: Sad. Th e r a p i s T: What was going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: [further describing the situation instead of relating her auto -matic thoughts] I was looking at the people in the park, hanging out, playing Frisbee, things like that. Th e r a p i s T: What was going through your mind when you saw them? pa Ti e n T: I’ll never be like them. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. [providing psychoeducation] You just identified what we call an automatic thought . Everyone has them. They are thoughts that just seem to pop into our heads. We’re not deliberately try -ing to think about them; that’s why we call them automatic. Most of the time, they’re very quick and we’re much more aware of the emotion—in this case, sadness—than we are of the thoughts. Lots of times the thoughts are distorted in some way. But we react as if they’re true. pa Ti e n T: Hmmm. Th e r a p i s T: What we’ll do is teach you to identify your automatic thoughts, and then evaluate them to see just how accurate they are. For example, in a minute we’ll evaluate the thought, “I’ll never be like them. ” What do you think would happen to your emotions if you discovered that your thought wasn’t true—that when your depression lifts you’ll realize that you are like the people in the park? pa Ti e n T: I’d feel better. Here I suggest an alternative scenario in order to illustrate the cogni -tive model. Later in the session, I use Socratic questioning (see Chapter Identifying Automatic Thoughts 14111) to examine the thought with the patient so she can develop her own adaptive response. In the next part, I write down the automatic thought, emphasizing the cognitive model. Situation: Looking at people at the parkAutomatic thought: “I’ll never be like them. ”Emotion: Sad Th e r a p i s T: Let’s get that down on paper. When you have the thought, “I’ll never be like them, ” you feel sad. Do you see how what you’re thinking influences how you feel? pa Ti e n T: Uh-huh. Th e r a p i s T: That’s what we call the cognitive model . What we’ll do in therapy is teach you to identify your automatic thoughts when you notice your mood changing. That’s the first step. We’ll keep practic -ing it until it’s easy. Then you’ll learn how to evaluate your thoughts and change your thinking if it’s not completely right. Is that clear? pa Ti e n T: I think so. Th e r a p i s T: [checking on the patient’s understanding] Could you tell me in your own words about the relationship between thoughts and feelings? pa Ti e n T: Sometimes I have thoughts that are wrong and these thoughts make me feel bad . . . But what if the thoughts are right? Th e r a p i s T: Good point. Then we’ll do some problem solving or find out what’s so bad about it if they are right. My guess, though, is that we’ll find a lot of mistakes in your thinking because you are depressed. Unrealistically negative thinking is always part of depres -sion. In any case, we’ll figure out together whether your thoughts are right or wrong. At the end of this session, I check again to ascertain how well the patient seems to understand the cognitive model. Th e r a p i s T: To review a bit, could you tell me what you now understand about the relationship between thoughts and feelings? pa Ti e n T: Well, sometimes automatic thoughts just pop into my head and I accept them as true. And then I feel . . . whatever: sad, wor -ried . . . 142 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Good. How about for homework this week if you look for some of these automatic thoughts? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: Why do you think I’m suggesting this? pa Ti e n T: Because sometimes my thoughts aren’t true, and if I can fig -ure out what I’m thinking, I can change it around and feel better. Th e r a p i s T: That’s right. Okay, let’s write this assignment down: When -ever I notice a change in mood or my mood is getting worse, ask myself . . . Do you remember the question? pa Ti e n T: What was just going through my mind? Th e r a p i s T: Good! Get that down. El ICITING A UTO m ATIC T HOUGHTSThe skill of learning to identify automatic thoughts is analogous to learning any other skill. Some patients (and therapists) catch on quite easily and quickly. Others need much more guidance and practice to identify automatic thoughts and images. The basic question you will ask is:“What was going through your mind? ”You will ask this question:When patients describe a problematic situation that arose, usu - • ally since your previous session together, or When you notice a shift to, or intensification of, negative affect • during a session. This latter situation is often important and it is vital to be alert to both verbal and nonverbal cues from the patient, so as to be able to elicit their “hot cognitions”—that is, important automatic thoughts and images that arise in the therapy session itself, and are associated with a change or increase in emotion. These hot cognitions may be about the patient herself (“I’m such a failure”), the therapist (“She doesn’t under -stand me”), or the subject under discussion (“It’s not fair that I have so much to do”) and may undermine the patient’s motivation or sense of adequacy or worth. They may interfere with the patient’s concentra -tion in session. Finally, they may interfere with the therapeutic relation - Identifying Automatic Thoughts 143 ship. Identifying automatic thoughts on the spot gives the patient the opportunity to test and respond to the thoughts immediately, so as to facilitate the work in the rest of the session. How do you know when patients have experienced an affect shift? You are on the alert for nonverbal cues such as changes in facial expres -sion, tightening of muscles, shifts in posture, or hand gestures. Verbal cues include change in tone, pitch, volume, or pace. Having noticed a change, you infer an affect shift and check it out by asking patients what just went through their mind. Difficulties in Eliciting Automatic Thoughts If patients are unable to answer the question “What was just going through your mind? ” you can:1. Ask them how they are/were feeling and where in their body they experienced the emotion. 2. Elicit a detailed description of the problematic situation. 3. Request that the patient visualize the distressing situation. 4. Suggest that the patient role-play the specific interaction with you (if the distressing situation was interpersonal). 5. Elicit an image. 6. Supply thoughts opposite to the ones you hypothesize actually went through their minds. 7. Ask for the meaning of the situation. 8. Phrase the question differently. These techniques are illustrated in the transcripts below. Heightening the Emotional and Physiological Response Th e r a p i s T: Sally, when you were thinking about volunteering in class, what was just going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: How were you feeling? pa Ti e n T: Anxious, I think. Th e r a p i s T: Where did you feel the anxiety? pa Ti e n T: Here ( pointing to her abdomen ). In the pit of my stomach. Th e r a p i s T: Can you feel the same feeling now? 144 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: (Nods . )Th e r a p i s T: So you’re sitting in class, thinking about volunteering, and you feel that anxiety in the pit of your stomach . . . What’s going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: If I say something, it won’t come out right. People will judge me. Eliciting a Detailed Description Th e r a p i s T: So, you were alone in your room last night and you began feeling really upset? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: What was going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. I was just feeling so down, sad. Th e r a p i s T: Can you describe the scene for me? What time was it? Were you alone? What were you doing? What else was going on? pa Ti e n T: It was about 6:15. I had just gotten back from dinner. The dorm was pretty empty because I ate early. I was about to get my books out of my backpack so I could do my Chem homework . . . Th e r a p i s T: So you were about to do your homework and you were thinking . . . pa Ti e n T: [expressing her automatic thoughts] This is just too hard. I’ll never understand it. Th e r a p i s T: And then what happened? pa Ti e n T: I just lay down on my bed. Th e r a p i s T: And as you were lying there, what was going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I don’t want to do this. I don’t want to be here. Visualizing the Situation Th e r a p i s T: Sally, can you imagine that you’re back in the class right now, the professor is talking, the student next to you is whispering, you’re feeling nervous . . . Can you visualize it, as if it’s happening right now? How big is the class? Where are you sitting? What is the professor saying? What are you doing? And so on. pa Ti e n T: I’m in my Economics class. The professor is standing in front of the class. Let’s see, [shifting to past tense, which makes the expe -rience less immediate and decreases the emotional response] I was sitting about three-quarters of the way back, I was listening pretty hard . . . Identifying Automatic Thoughts 145 Th e r a p i s T: [guiding the patient to speak as if it’s happening right at the moment] So, “I’m sitting three-quarters of the way back, I’m listening pretty hard . . . ”pa Ti e n T: She’s saying something about what topics we can choose, a macroeconomic view of the economy or . . . something, and then this guy on my left leans over and whispers, “When’s the paper due? ”Th e r a p i s T: And what’s going through your mind right now? pa Ti e n T: What did she say? What did I miss? Now I won’t know what to do. Re-Creating an Interpersonal Situation through Role Play Patients describe who said what verbally, then patients play themselves while you play the other person in the interaction. Th e r a p i s T: So, you were feeling down as you were talking to your class -mate about the assignment? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: What was going through your mind as you were talking to her? pa Ti e n T: (Pauses . ) . . . I don’t know. I was just really down. Th e r a p i s T: Can you tell me what you said to her and what she said to you? pa Ti e n T: (Describes verbal exchange . )Th e r a p i s T: How about if we try a role play? I’ll be the classmate and you be you. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: While we’re recreating the situation, see if you can figure out what’s going through your mind. pa Ti e n T: (Nods . )Th e r a p i s T: Okay, you start. What do you say first? pa Ti e n T: Lisa, can I ask you a question? Th e r a p i s T: Sure, but can you call me later? I’ve got to run to my next class. pa Ti e n T: It’s fast. I just missed part of what Dr. Smith said about our paper. Th e r a p i s T: I’m really in a hurry now. Call me after 7 o’clock, okay? Bye . . . Okay, out of role play. Were you aware of what was going through your mind? 146 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: Yeah. I was thinking that she was too busy for me, that she didn’t really want to help me, and I wouldn’t know what to do. Th e r a p i s T: You had the thoughts, “She’s too busy for me, ” “She doesn’t really want to help me, ” “I won’t know what to do. ”pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: And those thoughts made you feel sad? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Eliciting an Image Th e r a p i s T: So, when I asked, “How’s school going? ” you felt sad. What was going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I think I was thinking about my Economics class, getting my paper back. Th e r a p i s T: Did you imagine that? Did you have an image in your mind? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. I pictured a “C” at the top, in red ink. Suggesting an Opposite Thought Th e r a p i s T: So when you were sitting alone in your room, were you thinking how great everything is going? pa Ti e n T: No, not at all! I was thinking that I don’t know whether I belong here. Uncovering the Meaning of the Situation Th e r a p i s T: What did it mean to you that you got a B– on your paper? pa Ti e n T: That I’m not smart enough. I don’t have what it takes. Phrasing the Question Differently Th e r a p i s T: So when your mom didn’t call you back, what were you thinking? Were you making a prediction? Were you remembering something? It is also possible, though usually less desirable, to ask patients, “What do you guess what you were thinking? ” or “Could you have been think -ing about or ? ” because patients may spec -ulate inaccurately. Sometimes, however, these two questions are effec -tive. Identifying Automatic Thoughts 147 You will try one or more of the techniques above when patients have difficulty identifying their automatic thoughts. But if they still experience difficulty, you might collaboratively decide to change the subject, to avoid patients’ feeling that they are being interrogated, or to reduce the possibility of their viewing themselves as a failure:Th e r a p i s T: Well, sometimes these thoughts are hard to catch. No big deal. How about if we move on to . Identifying Additional Automatic Thoughts It is important to continue questioning patients even after they report an initial automatic thought. Additional questioning may bring to light other important thoughts. Th e r a p i s T: So when you got the test back, you thought, “I should have done better. I should have studied harder. ” What else went through your mind? pa Ti e n T: Everyone else probably did better than I did. Th e r a p i s T: Then what? pa Ti e n T: I was thinking, “I shouldn’t even be here. I’m such a failure. ”You should be aware that patients may, in addition, have other automatic thoughts not about the same situation itself, but about their reaction to that situation. They may perceive their emotion, behavior, or physiological reaction in a negative way. Th e r a p i s T: So you had the thought, “I might embarrass myself, ” and you felt anxious? Then what happened? pa Ti e n T: My heart started beating real fast and I thought, “What’s wrong with me? ”Th e r a p i s T: And you felt. . . ? pa Ti e n T: More anxious. Th e r a p i s T: And then? pa Ti e n T: I thought, “I’ll never feel okay. ”Th e r a p i s T: And you felt. . . ? pa Ti e n T: Sad and hopeless. Th e r a p i s T: And then. . . ? pa Ti e n T: I felt so bad I thought I wouldn’t be much fun at lunch with Allison so I told her I wasn’t feeling well and just went back to my room. 148 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Note that the patient first had automatic thoughts about a specific situation (volunteering in class). Then she had thoughts about her anxiety and her bodily reaction. In many cases, these secondary emo -tional reactions can be quite distressing, and significantly compound an already upsetting situation. Then Sally made a negative prediction that affected her behavior. To work most efficiently, it is important to determine at which point patients were most distressed (before, during, or after a given incident), and what their automatic thoughts were at that point. Patients may have had distressing automatic thoughts:Before• a situation, in anticipation of what might happen (“What if she yells at me? ”), During• a situation (“She thinks I’m stupid”), and/or After• a situation, reflecting on what had happened (“I can’t do anything right; I never should have tried”). Identifying the Problematic Situation Sometimes, in addition to being unable to identify automatic thoughts associated with a given emotion, patients have difficulty even identify -ing a particular situation or issue that is most troublesome to them (or which part is the most upsetting). When this happens, you can help them pinpoint the most problematic situation by proposing a number of upsetting problems, asking them to hypothetically eliminate one problem, and determining how much relief the patient feels. Once a specific situation has been identified, the automatic thoughts are more easily uncovered. Th e r a p i s T: [summarizing] So, you’ve been very upset for the past few days and you’re not sure why, and you’re having trouble identifying your thoughts—you just feel upset most of the time. Is that right? pa Ti e n T: Yes. I just don’t know why I’ve been so upset all the time. Th e r a p i s T: What kinds of things have you been thinking about? pa Ti e n T: Well, school for one. And I’m not getting along well with my roommate. And then I tried to get hold of my mother again and I couldn’t reach her, and, I don’t know, just everything. Th e r a p i s T: So, there is a problem with school, with your roommate, with reaching your mom . . . anything else? Identifying Automatic Thoughts 149 pa Ti e n T: Yeah. I haven’t been feeling too well. I’m afraid I might be getting sick. Th e r a p i s T: Which of these situations bothers you the most—school, roommate, reaching your mom, feeling sick? pa Ti e n T: Oh, I don’t know. I’m worried about all of them. Th e r a p i s T: Let’s jot these four things down. Now let’s say hypotheti -cally we could completely eliminate the feeling sick problem. Let’s say you now feel physically fine, how anxious are you now? pa Ti e n T: About the same. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. Say, hypothetically, you do reach your mom right away after therapy, and everything’s fine with her. How do you feel now? pa Ti e n T: A little bit better. Not that much. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. Let’s say the school problem—what is the school problem? pa Ti e n T: I have a paper due next week. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, let’s say you’ve just handed the paper in early, and you’re feeling good about it. Now how do you feel? pa Ti e n T: That would be a great relief, if that paper were done and I thought I’d done well. Th e r a p i s T: So it sounds as if it’s the paper that is the most distressing situation. pa Ti e n T: Yeah. I think so. Th e r a p i s T: Now, just to make sure . . . If you still had the paper to do, but the roommate problem disappeared, how would you feel? pa Ti e n T: Not that good. I think it is the paper that’s bothering me the most. Th e r a p i s T: In a moment, we’ll focus on the school problem, but first I’d like to review how we figured it out, so you’ll be able to do it yourself in the future. pa Ti e n T: Well, you had me list all the things I was worried about, and pretend to solve them one by one. Th e r a p i s T: And then you were able to see which one would give you the most relief if it had been resolved. pa Ti e n T: Yeah. We then focus on the school problem, identifying and responding to automatic thoughts and doing some problem solving. 150 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND The same process can be used in helping the patient to determine which part of a seemingly overwhelming problem is most distressing. Th e r a p i s T: So you’ve been pretty upset about your roommate. What specifically has been bothering you? pa Ti e n T: Oh, I don’t know. Everything. Th e r a p i s T: Can you name some things? pa Ti e n T: Well, she’s been taking my food and not replacing it. Not in a malicious way, but it still bothers me. And she’s got a boyfriend, and whenever she talks about him, it reminds me that I don’t have one. And she’s messy; she leaves stuff all around . . . And she’s kind of inconsiderate. Sometimes she talks really loudly on her cell phone. Th e r a p i s T: Anything else? pa Ti e n T: Those are the major things. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, we’ve done this before. Let me read these back to you so you can figure out which one bothers you the most. If you can’t, we’ll hypothetically eliminate them one by one, and see which one makes the biggest difference in how you feel. Okay? Differentiating between Automatic Thoughts and Interpretations When you ask for patients’ automatic thoughts, you are seeking the actual words or images that have gone through their mind. Until they have learned to recognize these thoughts, many patients report inter-pretations , which may or may not reflect their actual thoughts. In the following transcript, I guide a patient in reporting her thoughts. Th e r a p i s T: When you saw that woman in the cafeteria, what went through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I think I was denying my real feelings. Th e r a p i s T: What were you actually thinking? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure what you mean. In this exchange, the patient reported an interpretation of what she was feeling and thinking. Below, I try again, by focusing on and heighten -ing her emotion. Th e r a p i s T: When you saw her, what emotion did you feel? pa Ti e n T: I think I was just denying my feelings. Th e r a p i s T: Uh-huh. What feelings were you denying? Identifying Automatic Thoughts 151 pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: [supplying an emotion opposite to the expected one to jog her recall] When you saw her, did you feel happy? Excited? pa Ti e n T: No, not at all. Th e r a p i s T: Can you remember walking into the cafeteria and seeing her? Can you picture that in your mind? pa Ti e n T: Uh-huh. Th e r a p i s T: What are you feeling? pa Ti e n T: Sad, I think. Th e r a p i s T: As you look at her, what goes through your mind? pa Ti e n T: [reporting an emotion and a physiological reaction, instead of an automatic thought] I feel really sad, an emptiness in the pit of my stomach. Th e r a p i s T: What’s going through your mind now? pa Ti e n T: She’s really smart. [automatic thought] I’m nothing com -pared to her. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. Anything else? pa Ti e n T: No. I just walked over to the table and started talking to my friend. Specifying Automatic Thoughts Embedded in Discourse Patients need to learn to specify the actual words that go through their minds in order to evaluate them effectively. Following are some exam -ples of embedded thoughts versus actual words:Embedded expressions Actual automatic thoughts I guess I was wondering if he likes me. Does he like me? I don’t know if going to the professor would be a waste of time. It’ll probably be a waste of time if I go. I couldn’t get myself to start reading. I can’t do this. You gently lead patients to identify the actual words that went through their mind. Th e r a p i s T: So when you turned bright red in class, what went through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I guess I was wondering if he thought I was strange. 152 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Can you recall the exact words you were thinking? pa Ti e n T: (puzzled ) I’m not sure what you mean. Th e r a p i s T: Were you thinking, “I guess I was wondering if he thought I was strange, ” or were you thinking, “Does he think I’m strange? ”pa Ti e n T: Oh, I see, the second one. Or actually I think it was, “He prob -ably thinks I’m strange. ”Changing the Form of Telegraphic or Question Thoughts Patients often report thoughts that are not fully spelled out. As it is dif -ficult to evaluate such a telegraphic thought, you guide the patient to express the thought more fully. Th e r a p i s T: What went through your mind when the paper was announced? pa Ti e n T: “Uh-oh. ” I just thought, “Uh-oh. ”Th e r a p i s T: Can you spell the thought out? “Uh-oh” means . . . pa Ti e n T: I’ll never get the work done in time. I have too much to do. If patients are unable to spell out their thought, you might try supplying an opposite thought: “Did ‘Uh-oh’ mean, ‘That’s really good’? ”Automatic thoughts are sometimes expressed in the form of a question, making evaluation difficult. Therefore, you guide patients in expressing their thoughts in a statement form prior to helping them evaluate it. Th e r a p i s T: So you felt anxious? What was going through your mind right then? pa Ti e n T: I was thinking, “Will I pass the test? ”Th e r a p i s T: Okay. Were you thinking you probably would or wouldn’t pass the test? pa Ti e n T: That I wouldn’t. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. So can we rephrase your thought as, “I might not pass the test”? Another example follows:Th e r a p i s T: So you had the thought, “What will happen to me [if I get more and more nervous]? ” What are you afraid could happen? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know . . . lose control, I guess. Identifying Automatic Thoughts 153 Th e r a p i s T: Okay, let’s look at that thought, “I could lose control. ”Here I lead the patient into revealing precisely what she fears. In the next example, the patient initially has difficulty identifying the fear behind her automatic thought. I try several different questions. Th e r a p i s T: So you thought, “What next? ” What did you think would happen next? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. Th e r a p i s T: Were you afraid something specific might happen? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: What’s the worst thing that could happen in this situation? pa Ti e n T: Ummm . . . that I’d get kicked out of school. Th e r a p i s T: Do you think that was what you were afraid would hap -pen? Other examples of how questions can be restated in order to be evaluated more effectively are presented below:Question Statement“Will I be able to cope? ” “I won’t be able to cope. ”“Can I stand it if she leaves? ” “I won’t be able to stand it if she leaves. ”“What if I can’t do it? ” “I’ll lose my job if I can’t do it. ”“What if she gets mad at me? ” “She’ll hurt me if she gets mad at me. ”“How will I get through it? ” “I won’t be able to get through it. ”“What if I can’t change? ” “I’ll be miserable forever if I can’t change. ”“Why did this happen to me? ” “This shouldn’t have happened to me. ”Recognizing Situations That Can Evoke Automatic Thoughts Up to this point, most of the examples of automatic thoughts provided in this chapter have been associated with external events (e. g. , talking to a friend) or a stream of thoughts (e. g. , thinking about an upcoming exam). But a wide range of both external stimuli and internal experi -ences can give rise to automatic thoughts. As illustrated in Figure 9. 1, 154 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Situation (external event, stream of thoughts, or internal experiences)Initial Automatic Thoughts Emotion Behavior Physiological Reaction Potential Additional Automatic Thoughts Emotion Behavior Physiological Reaction FIGURE 9. 2. Initial and secondary thoughts and reactions. Situation/Stimulus Example Automatic Thoughts External event (or series of events)mother keeps hanging up the phone. “How dare she treat me like this! ”Stream of thoughts Thinking about the exam “I’ll never learn this stuff. ”Cognition: thought, image, belief, daydream, dream, memory, flashback Becomes aware of a violent image. “I must be crazy. ”Has a flashback of a traumatic event“I’ll never get over this. I’ll always be plagued by these terrible flashbacks. ”Emotion Anger “I shouldn’t be angry at him. I’m such a bad person. ”Behavior Binge eats “I’m so weak. I just can’t get my eating under control. ”Physiological or mental experience Rapid heartbeat “What if there’s something seriously wrong with me? ”Sense of unreality “I must be going crazy. ”FIGURE 9. 1. Situations that evoke automatic thoughts. Identifying Automatic Thoughts 155 patients may have automatic thoughts in other categories, too. They can have thoughts about their cognitions (thoughts, images, beliefs, day -dreams, dreams, memories, or flashbacks), their emotions, their behav -ior, or their physiological or mental experiences. Any of these stimuli may engender an initial automatic thought (or series of automatic thoughts), followed by an initial emotional, behavioral, and/or physi -ological reaction. Patients may then have additional thoughts about any part of the cognitive model, leading to an additional associated emo -tional, behavioral, and/or physiological reaction (Figure 9. 2). TEACHING P ATIENTS TO I DENTI f Y AUTO m ATIC THOUGHTSAs described in Chapter 5, you can begin teaching patients the skill of identifying automatic thoughts even during the first session. Here I have just demonstrated the cognitive model, using Sally’s own examples. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, when you notice your mood changing or getting worse in the next week, could you stop and ask yourself, “What is going through my mind right now? ”pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: Maybe you could jot down a few of these thoughts on a piece of paper? pa Ti e n T: Sure. In later sessions, you might also explicitly teach the patient other techniques if the basic question (“What’s going through your mind right now? ”) is not effective. Th e r a p i s T: Sometimes you may not be able to tell what you were think -ing. So either at the time or later, you can try what we just did here in session. Replay the scene as vividly as you can in your imagina -tion, as if it’s happening again, and concentrate on how you’re feel -ing. Then ask yourself, “What’s going through my mind? ” Do you think you could do that? Or should we practice it again? pa Ti e n T: I’ll give it a try. Again, if asking the basic questions and trying the imagery tech -nique are not sufficient, you might explicitly teach the patient to hypothesize about her thoughts. This method is less desirable because it is more likely the patient will report a later interpretation instead of her actual thoughts at the time. 156 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: If you still have trouble figuring out what was going through your mind, here are some other questions [see Figure 9. 3 you can ask yourself. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: First question: If I had to, what would I guess I was thinking about? Or could I have been thinking about or ? Or, was I imagining something or remembering something? Or, finally, what does this situation mean to me? Or you might try to figure out what the opposite thought might be to jog your memory. pa Ti e n T: Okay.

From J. S. Beck (2011). Copyright 2011 by Judith S. Beck. Reprinted by permission. Identifying Automatic Thoughts 157 Th e r a p i s T: How about trying out these questions this week if you have trouble identifying your automatic thoughts, and if imagining the situation again doesn’t help? pa Ti e n T: Fine. To summarize, people with psychological disorders make predict -able errors in their thinking. You teach patients to identify their dys -functional thinking, then to evaluate and modify it. The process starts with the recognition of specific automatic thoughts in specific situa -tions. Identifying automatic thoughts is a skill that comes easily and naturally to some patients and is more difficult for others. You need to listen closely to ensure that patients report actual thoughts, and you may need to vary your questioning if patients do not readily identify their thoughts. The next chapter clarifies, among other things, the dif -ference between automatic thoughts and emotions. 158 Chapter 10 IDENTIf YING Em OTIONSEmotions are of primary importance in cognitive behavior therapy. After all, the major goals of treatment are symptom relief (espe-cially a reduction in the patient’s level of distress) and a remission of the patient’s disorder. Intense negative emotion is painful and may be dysfunctional if it interferes with a patient’s capacity to think clearly, solve problems, act effectively, or gain satisfaction. Patients with a psychiatric disorder often experience an intensity of emotion that can seem excessive or inappropriate to the situation. Sally, for example, felt enormous guilt and then sadness when she had to cancel a minor social event with her roommate. She was also extremely anxious about going to a professor for help. Yet the intensity and quality of patients’ emotions make sense when you recognize the strength of their automatic thoughts and the beliefs (which are usually quite painful) that have become activated. It is important to acknowledge and empathize with how patients feel and refrain from challenging or disputing their emotions. Evaluate the thoughts and beliefs that underlie patients’ distress to reduce their dysphoria; do not evaluate their emotions. You won’t discuss all situations in which patients feel dysphoric, though—you will use your conceptualization of the patient to decide which problems are most important. Typically, the most important problems are those associated with high levels of distress. Problems in which patients seem to be having a “normal” level of distress are usu-ally less important. The aim of cognitive behavior therapy is not to get Identifying Emotions 159 rid of all distress; negative emotions are as much a part of the richness of life as positive emotions and serve as important a function as does physical pain, often alerting us to potential problems that may need to be addressed. In addition, you will seek to increase patients’ positive emotions through discussion (usually relatively brief) of their interests, positive events that occurred during the week, and positive memories. You will often suggest homework assignments aimed at increasing the number of activities in which the patient is likely to experience mastery and pleasure (see Chapter 6). This chapter explains how to:Differentiate automatic thoughts from emotions. • Distinguish among emotions. • label emotions. • Rate the intensity of emotions. • DISTINGUISHING A UTO m ATIC T HOUGHTS f ROm Em OTIONSMany patients do not clearly understand the difference between their thoughts and their emotions. You will endeavor to make sense of the patients’ experience and share your understanding with them. You will continually and subtly help patients view their experiences through the cognitive model. You will organize the material patients present into the categories of the cognitive model: situation, automatic thought, and reaction (i. e. , emotion, behavior, and physiological response). Be alert to occasions when patients confuse their thoughts and emotions. At these times, based on the flow of the session, their goals, and the strength of the collaboration, you may decide to:Ignore the confusion, • Address it at the time (either subtly or explicitly), or• Address it later. • Most of the time, mislabeling a thought as a feeling is relatively unimportant in a given context, and you can make a subtle correction. 160 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: You mentioned when we set the agenda that you wanted to talk about the phone call you had with your brother? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. I called him a couple of nights ago and he sounded kind of distant. Th e r a p i s T: And how were you feeling emotionally? pa Ti e n T: I felt like he really didn’t want to talk, like he didn’t really care whether I had called or not. Th e r a p i s T: So when you had the thoughts, “He doesn’t really want to talk. He doesn’t really care that I called, ” how did you feel emotion -ally? Sad? Angry? Something else? In another session, I viewed the confusion as important because I wanted to teach Sally how to evaluate her thinking, using the Thought Record (page 195). I deliberately decided to distinguish the two, judg -ing that it was important to do so at the time, and that the flow of the session would not be unduly interrupted and that important data would not be forgotten. Th e r a p i s T: Were there any times this week when you thought about going out for a walk? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, a few times. Th e r a p i s T: Can you remember one time specifically? pa Ti e n T: Last night after dinner, I was cleaning up . . . I don’t know. Th e r a p i s T: How were you feeling emotionally? pa Ti e n T: [expressing thoughts] Oh, I was feeling like it’s no use, that it probably wouldn’t help. Th e r a p i s T: Those are important thoughts. We’ll get back to evaluat -ing them in a minute, but first I’d like to review the difference between thoughts and feelings. Okay? pa Ti e n T: Sure. Th e r a p i s T: Feelings are what you feel emotionally —usually they’re one word, such as sadness, anger, anxiety, and so on. ( pause ) Thoughts are ideas that you have; you think them either in words or in pic -tures or images. ( pause ) Do you see what I mean? pa Ti e n T: I think so. Th e r a p i s T: So let’s get back to the time last night when you thought about going out for a walk. What emotion were you feeling? pa Ti e n T: Sad, I think. Th e r a p i s T: And your thoughts were, “This is no use. I’ll never get bet -ter”? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Identifying Emotions 161 In the examples above, Sally initially labeled thoughts as feelings. At times, patients do the reverse: that is, they label an emotion as a thought. Th e r a p i s T: As you walked into your empty dorm room, Sally, what went through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I was sad, lonely, real down. Th e r a p i s T: So you felt sad and lonely and down. What thought or image made you feel that way? Importance of Distinguishing among Emotions You continuously conceptualize patients’ problems, trying to understand their experience and point of view and how their underlying beliefs give rise to specific automatic thoughts in a specific situation, influencing their emotions and behavior. The connection among patients’ thoughts, emotion, and behavior should make sense. You will investigate further when patients report an emotion that does not seem to match the content of their automatic thoughts, as in the transcript below. Th e r a p i s T: How did you feel when your mother didn’t call you back right away? pa Ti e n T: I was sad. Th e r a p i s T: What was going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I was thinking, “What if something happened to her? Maybe there’s something wrong. ”Th e r a p i s T: And you felt sad? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: I’m a little confused because those sound more like anx-ious thoughts. Was there anything else going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: How about if we have you imagine the scene? [helping the patient vividly recall the scene in imagery form] You said you were sitting by the phone, waiting for her call? pa Ti e n T: And then I thought, “What if something happened? Maybe there’s something wrong. ”Th e r a p i s T: What happens next? pa Ti e n T: I’m looking at the phone, and I get teary. Th e r a p i s T: What’s going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: If anything happened to Mom, there would be no one left who cares. 162 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: “There would be no one left who cares. ” How does that thought make you feel? pa Ti e n T: Sad. Real sad. This interchange started with a discrepancy. I was alert and so was able to pick up an inconsistency between the content of the automatic thought and the emotion associated with it. I was then able to help Sally retrieve a key automatic thought by using imaginal recall. Had I cho -sen to focus on the anxious thoughts, I may have missed Sally’s cen -tral concern. Although it may have been helpful to focus on a less cen -tral thought, finding and working with key automatic thoughts usually speeds up therapy. DIff ICUl TY IN l ABE l ING Em OTIONSMost patients easily and correctly label their emotions. Some, how -ever, display a relatively impoverished vocabulary for emotions; others understand emotional labels intellectually but have difficulty labeling their own specific emotions. In either of these two cases, it is useful to have patients link their emotional reactions in specific situations to their labels. Devising an “Emotion Chart” such as the one in Figure 10. 1 helps patients learn to label their emotions more effectively. Patients can list current or previous situations in which they felt a particular emotion and refer back to it whenever they are having difficulty nam -ing how they felt. Th e r a p i s T: I’d like to spend a few minutes talking about different emotions so we can both understand better how you feel in differ -ent situations. Okay? Angry Sad Anxious 1. Brother cancels plans with me. 1. m om doesn’t return phone call. 1. Seeing how low my bank account is. 2. f riend doesn’t return my gym bag. 2. Not enough money to go away on vacation. 2. Hearing that we might have a tornado. 3. Carpool driver plays music too loudly. 3. Nothing to do on Saturday. 3. f inding a bump on my neck. FIGURE 10. 1. Sample Emotion Chart. Identifying Emotions 163 pa Ti e n T: Sure. Th e r a p i s T: Can you remember a time when you felt angry? pa Ti e n T: Uh, yeah . . . When my brother cancelled plans to see this movie; I forget which one, but I really wanted to go. Anyway, he told me he was going out with his friends instead . . . Th e r a p i s T: And what was going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: Who does he think he is? I wouldn’t do that to him. He should treat me better. Th e r a p i s T: And you felt—pa Ti e n T: Mad. Here I had the patient recall a specific event in which he felt a given emotion. From his description, it sounded as if he had correctly identi -fied his emotion. Because I wanted to make sure, I asked him to iden -tify his automatic thoughts. The content of the automatic thoughts did match his stated emotion. Next, I asked the patient to recall other occasions when he felt angry, sad, and anxious. Again I asked for his specific automatic thoughts in these situations to ensure he was accurately labeling his emotions. We then created the Emotion Chart (Figure 10. 1). I asked the patient to refer to it in session and at home whenever he was having difficulty labeling what he was feeling. It is not necessary to use this technique to differentiate emotions with most patients. Others may benefit from a quick discussion along the above lines. A few might profit from a list of negative emotions (see Figure 10. 2) and a brief discussion. Sad, down, lonely, unhappy Anxious, worried, fearful, scared, tense Angry, mad, irritated, annoyed Ashamed, embarrassed, humiliated Disappointed Jealous, envious Guilty Hurt Suspicious FIGURE 10. 2. Negative emotions. 164 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND RATING D EGREES O f Em OTIONIt is sometimes important for patients not only to identify th e ir e m o -tions, but also to quantify the degree of emotion they are experiencing. Some have dysfunctional beliefs about experiencing emotion (Green -berg, 2002; Holland, 2003; Leahy, 2003)—for example, believing that if they feel a small amount of distress, it will increase and become intol -erable. Learning to rate the intensity of emotions aids patients in test -ing this belief. In addition, you will assess whether questioning and adaptively responding to a thought or belief have been effective, so you can judge whether a cognition requires further intervention. Failure to do so may sometimes lead you to inaccurately conclude that an intervention has succeeded, and you may proceed to the next thought or problem pre -maturely. Or the opposite may happen—you may continue discussing an automatic thought or belief, not realizing that the patient is no lon -ger significantly distressed by it. Finally, gauging the intensity of an emotion in a given situation helps you and the patient determine whether that situation warrants closer scrutiny. A situation that is relatively less emotionally laden may be less valuable to discuss than one that is more distressing to the patient, where important beliefs may have been activated. Most patients learn to judge the intensity of an emotion fairly eas -ily. Th e r a p i s T: How did you feel when your friend said, “Sorry, I don’t have time now”? pa Ti e n T: Pretty sad, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: If 100% is the saddest you ever felt or could imagine feel -ing, and 0% is completely not sad, how sad did you feel right when he said, “Sorry, I don’t have time now”? pa Ti e n T: About 75%. Some patients have difficulty with or don’t like putting a specific number to the intensity. You can simply ask them to rate whether they experienced the emotion “a little, ” “a medium amount, ” “very, ” or “com -pletely. ” If even that is difficult, drawing a scale can help:Not sad at all A little sad medium sad Very sad Completely sad (saddest I have been or could imagine being) Identifying Emotions 165 Th e r a p i s T: How did you feel when your friend said, “Sorry, I don’t have time now”? pa Ti e n T: Sad. Th e r a p i s T: How sad did you feel, 0 to 100%? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure. I’m not too good with numbers. Th e r a p i s T: Do you think you felt a little sad? A medium amount sad? Very sad? Or completely sad? pa Ti e n T: What were the choices again? Th e r a p i s T: Here, let me draw a scale. Your sadness—would you say (pointing to the scale ) that you were a just a little, a medium amount, very sad, or completely sad? pa Ti e n T: Oh, very sad. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, we’ve got our scale now. Let’s see how useful it is. Were you sad any other times this week? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, last night when I locked myself out of my room. Th e r a p i s T: Use your new scale as a guide. About how sad did you feel? pa Ti e n T: Well, between a medium amount and very sad. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Now, do you think you could use this scale as a guide whenever you’re trying to figure out how sad you are? pa Ti e n T: Yes, I can do that. USING Em OTIONA l INTENSITY TO G UIDE T HERAPYPatients may not realize which situations they should bring up for dis -cussion. You can ask them to rate the degree of distress they are still experiencing to decide whether discussion of a given situation is likely to help. In the next transcript, I quickly realize that Sally and I will probably not accomplish much by focusing on an initial situation that she has described:Th e r a p i s T: So a problem you want to talk about has to do with your roommate? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: Did something come up this week? pa Ti e n T: Well, I felt bad when she went out with her boyfriend instead of me. Th e r a p i s T: How bad did you feel, 0 to 100%? 166 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. Maybe 25%? Th e r a p i s T: And now? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks . ) Less. Th e r a p i s T: Sounds like this wasn’t a terribly upsetting situation. Was there another time this week when you got pretty upset with her? In summary, you aim to obtain a clear picture of situations that are distressing to patients. You help them clearly differentiate their thoughts from their emotions. You empathize with their emotions throughout this process and help them evaluate the dysfunctional thinking that has influenced their mood. 167 Chapter 11 EVAl UATING AUTOm ATIC THOUGHTSPatients have hundreds or thousands of thoughts a day, some dys-functional, some not. You will have time to evaluate only few, at most, in a given session. This chapter describes how to:Select key automatic thoughts. • Use Socratic questioning to evaluate automatic thoughts. • Assess the outcome of the evaluation process. • Conceptualize when evaluation is ineffective. • Use alternate methods of questioning and responding to • automatic thoughts. Respond when automatic thoughts are true. • Teach patients to evaluate their automatic thoughts. • SEl ECTING k EY AUTOm ATIC THOUGHTSYou have identifi ed an automatic thought. Patients may have made a spontaneous utterance during a session (e. g. , “I just don’t think any-thing can help me”); related an automatic thought, often from the past week; or reported an automatic thought they predict will arise in the future. Next you need to conceptualize whether this is an important 168 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND thought on which to focus; that is, is it currently distressing or dysfunc -tional or likely to recur? If it was an automatic thought from the past week, you might ask:“In what situation did you have this thought? How much did you believe it at the time? How much do you believe it now? ”“How did it make you feel emotionally? How intense was the emotion then? How intense is the emotion now? ”“What did you do? ”You will also ask yourself whether the patient is likely to have this kind of thought again and be distressed by it. You will vary these questions slightly if the patient spontaneously uttered the thought and/or if the thought is related to a future situation. You also should find out whether additional thoughts were more central or distressing:“What else went through your mind [in this situation]? Did you have any other thoughts or images? ”“Which thought/image was most upsetting? ”In the transcript below, I determine that Sally’s automatic thought was important:Th e r a p i s T: [summarizing] So you were in class on Thursday, and you didn’t know the answers to questions that your professor threw out to the class, and you felt really sad because you thought, “I’ll never make it here. ” How much did you believe that thought, and how sad did you feel? pa Ti e n T: I believed it a lot, and I felt really sad. Th e r a p i s T: How much do you believe it now, and how sad do you feel now? pa Ti e n T: I still think I won’t make it. Th e r a p i s T: And is the thought still distressing? pa Ti e n T: Very. This turned out to be an important automatic thought for us to evalu -ate. In another case, though, Sally and I judged that a different auto -matic thought was probably not worth discussing. Sally was describing a Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 169 problem she had had in the library, and I asked her a few questions to evaluate whether this was an important situation to discuss. Th e r a p i s T: [summarizing] So you were in the library and you couldn’t find the book you needed, and you thought, “They are so ineffi -cient. The system is so bad, ” and you felt frustrated. How frustrated did you feel? pa Ti e n T: Oh, like 90%. Th e r a p i s T: Are you still that frustrated? pa Ti e n T: No, I got over it. Th e r a p i s T: What did you do when you were frustrated? pa Ti e n T: I went back to my room and worked on my chemistry prob -lems instead. I ended up borrowing the book from Lisa. I have to give it back to her by Monday, though. Th e r a p i s T: So you solved the problem. Do you think the library could be a problem in the future? Might you get frustrated and leave, but not do something productive? Or not get the book you need another way? pa Ti e n T: I think I’m all right. I know what to expect. If I hadn’t gotten the book from Lisa, I would have gone back to the library later and asked for help. Th e r a p i s T: That’s good . . . Sounds like you’ve got a plan in case any -thing else comes up. Should we move on to something else? Here I judge that the automatic thought, while upsetting at the time, did not warrant further discussion because (1) Sally was no lon -ger distressed by it, (2) she had acted in a functional way, (3) the situa -tion was resolved, and (4) she had a good solution if the same problem recurred. Why do patients bring up problems and automatic thoughts that are not important? Most of the time, it is because they are simply not socialized enough to treatment. But they can learn the skill of figuring out what is most important to talk about. Even if a patient reports an important automatic thought, you might decide not to focus on it, especially if:You judge that doing so might impair the therapeutic relationship • (e. g. , you perceive that the patient is feeling invalidated). The patient’s level of distress is too high to evaluate his thinking. • There’s insufficient time in the session to help the patient respond • effectively to the thought. 170 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND You assess that it is more important to work on another element of • the cognitive model (e. g. , you might focus instead on solving the problematic situation, teaching the patient emotional regulation techniques, discussing more adaptive behavioral responses, or addressing the patient’s physiological response). You assess that it is more important to elicit and work on a • dysfunctional belief underlying the automatic thought. You assess that it is more important to discuss a different problem. • QUESTIONING TO E VAl UATE AN A UTO m ATIC T HOUGHTHaving elicited an automatic thought, determined that it is important and distressing, and identified its accompanying reactions (emotional, physiological, and behavioral), you may collaboratively decide with the patient to evaluate it. You would rarely directly challenge the automatic thought , however, for three reasons. 1. You usually do not know in advance the degree to which any given automatic thought is distorted (e. g. , Sally’s thought that no one wanted to have dinner with her could have been valid). 2. A direct challenge can lead patients to feel invalidated (e. g. , Sally might think, “[m y therapist] is telling me I’m wrong”). 3. Challenging a cognition violates a fundamental principal of cognitive behavior therapy, that of collaborative empiricism: You and the patient together examine the automatic thought, test its validity and/or utility, and develop a more adaptive response. It is also important to keep in mind that automatic thoughts are rarely completely erroneous. Usually, they contain at least a grain of truth (which is important that you acknowledge). Figure 11. 1 contains a list of Socratic questions to help patients evaluate their thinking. (Actually, “Socratic” is a misnomer some of the time; the Socratic questioning method, derived from the philosopher Socrates, involves a dialectical discussion. ) Patients need a structured method to evaluate their thinking; otherwise, their responses to auto -matic thoughts can be superficial and unconvincing and will fail to improve their mood or functioning. The evaluation should be even-handed. You do not want patients, for example, to ignore evidence that Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 171 supports an automatic thought, devise an alternative explanation that is not likely, or adopt an unrealistically positive view of what might hap -pen. It is important to relate to patients that not all of the questions in Figure 11. 1 are suitable for every automatic thought. Moreover, using all of the questions, even if they logically apply, may be too cumbersome and time consuming. Patients may not evaluate their thoughts at all if they consider the process too burdensome. Usually you will introduce just one or a few questions at a time. You may use questioning from the very first session to evaluate a specific automatic thought. In a subsequent session, you will begin to explain the process more explicitly, so patients can learn to evaluate their thinking between sessions:Th e r a p i s T: (Summarizes past portion of the session; writes automatic thoughts on paper for both to see ) So when you met your friend Karen on the way to the class, you had the thought, “She doesn’t really care what happens to me, ” and that thought made you feel sad? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: And how much did you believe that thought at the time? pa Ti e n T: Oh, pretty much. About 90%. Th e r a p i s T: And how sad did you feel? pa Ti e n T: Maybe 80%. Th e r a p i s T: Do you remember what we said last week? Sometimes automatic thoughts are true, sometimes they turn out not to be true, and sometimes they have a grain of truth. Can we look at this thought about Karen now, and see how accurate it seems? pa Ti e n T: Okay. You can use any set of questions to help patients evaluate their thinking, but Figure 11. 1 can be helpful as it guides you and the patient to:Examine the validity of the automatic thought. • Explore the possibility of other interpretations or viewpoints. • Decatastrophize the problematic situation. • Recognize the impact of believing the automatic thought. • Gain distance from the thought. • Take steps to solve the problem. • 172 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Each of the questions is described below. The “Evidence” Questions Because automatic thoughts usually contain a grain of truth, patients usually do have some evidence that supports their accuracy (which you will seek first), but they often fail to recognize evidence to the contrary (which you will seek second):Th e r a p i s T: What’s the evidence that Karen doesn’t care what happens to you? pa Ti e n T: Well, when we passed on Locust Walk, she seemed like she was real rushed. She just quickly said, “Hi, Sally, see you later, ” and kept going fast. She hardly even looked at me. Th e r a p i s T: Anything else? pa Ti e n T: Well, sometimes she’s pretty busy and doesn’t have much time for me. Th e r a p i s T: Anything else? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks . ) No. I guess not. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, now is there any evidence on the other side, that maybe she does care about what happens to you? 1. What is the evidence that supports this idea? What is the evidence against this idea? 2. Is there an alternative explanation or viewpoint? 3. What is the worst that could happen (if I’m not already thinking the worst)? If it happened, how could I cope? What is the best that could happen? What is the most realistic outcome? 4. What is the effect of my believing the automatic thought? What could be the effect of changing my thinking? 5. What would I tell [a specific friend or family member] if he or she were in the same situation? 6. What should I do? FIGURE 11. 1. Questioning automatic thoughts. Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 173 pa Ti e n T: (answering in general terms ) Well, she is pretty nice. We’ve been friends since school started. Th e r a p i s T: [helping Sally think more specifically] What kinds of things does she do or say that might show she likes you? pa Ti e n T: Ummm . . . she usually asks if I want to go get something to eat with her. Sometimes we stay up pretty late just talking about things. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. So, on the one hand, on this occasion yesterday, she rushed by you, not saying much. And there have been other times, too, when she’s been pretty busy. But on the other hand, she asks you to eat with her, and you stay up late talking sometimes. Right? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Here I gently probed to uncover evidence regarding the validity of Sally’s thought. Having elicited evidence on both sides, I summarized what Sally said. The “Alternative Explanation” Questions Below, I help Sally devise a reasonable alternative explanation for what has happened. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Now, let’s look at the situation again. Could there be an alternative explanation for what happened, other than she doesn’t care about what happens to you? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. Th e r a p i s T: Why else might she have rushed by quickly? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure. She might have had a class. She might have been late for something. The “Decatastrophizing” Questions Many patients predict a worst-case scenario. If a patient’s automatic thought does not contain a catastrophe, it is often useful to ask the patients about their worst fear. In both cases, you should follow up by asking patients what they can do if the worst does happen. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. Now, what would be the worst that could happen in this situation? pa Ti e n T: That she would truly not like me, I guess. That I couldn’t count on her for support. 174 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: How could you cope with that? pa Ti e n T: Well, I wouldn’t be happy about it. I guess I’d have to stop counting on her friendship. Th e r a p i s T: [asking leading questions to help her develop a robust response] Do you have other friends you could count on? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: So you’d be okay? pa Ti e n T: Yes, I would. Patients’ worst fears are often unrealistic. Your objective is to help them think of more realistic outcomes, but many patients have diffi -culty doing so. You might help them extend their thinking by first ask -ing for the best outcome. Th e r a p i s T: Now the worst may be unlikely to happen. What’s the best that could happen? pa Ti e n T: That she’ll realize she cut me off. That she’ll apologize. Th e r a p i s T: And what’s the most realistic outcome ? pa Ti e n T: That she really was busy and we’ll continue to be friends. In the previous section, I help Sally see that even if the worst happened, she would cope. She also realizes that her worst fears are unlikely to come true. Q: What if . . . patients’ worst fears are that they will die? A: You obviously would not ask the “How would you cope? ” question. Instead you might ask for the best and most realistic outcomes. You may also decide to explore what the worst part of dying would be: fears of the process of dying, fears of what they imagine an afterlife might be like for them, or fears of what would happen to loved ones after the patient’s death. The “Impact of the Automatic Thought” Questions Below, I help Sally assess the consequences of responding and not responding to her distorted thinking. Th e r a p i s T: And what is the effect of your thinking that she doesn’t like you? pa Ti e n T: It makes me sad. I think it kind of makes me withdraw from her. Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 175 Th e r a p i s T: And what could be the effect of changing your thinking ? pa Ti e n T: I’d feel better. The “Distancing” Questions Patients often benefit from getting some distance from their thoughts by imagining what they would tell a close friend or family member in a similar situation. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, let’s say your friend Allison had a friend who some -times was rushed, but seemed caring at other times. If Allison had the thought, “My friend doesn’t care about me, ” what would you tell her? pa Ti e n T: I guess I’d tell her not to put too much importance on the times she seemed rushed, especially if her friend was nice about it. Th e r a p i s T: Does that apply to you? pa Ti e n T: Yes, I guess it does. The “Problem-Solving” Questions The answer to this question may be cognitive and/or behavioral in nature. The cognitive part would entail having patients remember their responses to the questions. In Sally’s case, we came up with a behavioral plan:Th e r a p i s T: And what do you think you should do about this situation? pa Ti e n T: Uh . . . I’m not sure what you mean. Th e r a p i s T: Well, have you withdrawn any since this happened yester -day? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, I think so. I didn’t say much when I saw her this morn -ing. Th e r a p i s T: So this morning you were still acting as if that original thought were true. How could you act differently? pa Ti e n T: I could talk to her more, be friendlier myself. If I were unsure of Sally’s social skills or motivation to carry through with this plan of being friendlier to Karen, I might have spent a few min -utes asking Sally such questions as “When might you see her again? ”; “Would it be worth it, do you think, to seek her out yourself? ”; “What could you say to her when you do see her? ”; “Anything you think could get in the way of your saying that? ” (If needed, I might have modeled what she could say to Karen, and/or engaged Sally in a role play. ) 176 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND ASSESSING THE O UTCO m E Of THE E VAl UATION P ROCESSIn the last part of this discussion, I assess how much Sally now believes the original automatic thought and how she feels emotionally, so I can decide what to do next in the session. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Now, how much do you believe this thought: “Karen doesn’t really care what happens to me”? pa Ti e n T: Not very much. Maybe 20%. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. And how sad do you feel? pa Ti e n T: Not much either. Th e r a p i s T: Good. It sounds like this exercise was useful. Let’s go back and see what we did that helped. You and the patient will not use all the questions in Figure 11. 1 for every automatic thought you evaluate. Sometimes none of the questions seems useful, and you might take another tack altogether (see pages 178 –186). CONCEPTUA l Iz ING W HY THE E VAl UATION Of AN A UTO m ATIC T HOUGHT W AS INEff ECTIVEIf the patient still believes the automatic thought to a significant degree and does not feel better emotionally, you need to conceptualize why this initial attempt at cognitive restructuring has not been sufficiently effective. Common reasons to consider include the following:1. There are other, more central automatic thoughts and/or images left unidentified or unevaluated. 2. The evaluation of the automatic thought is implausible, superficial, or inadequate. 3. The patient has not sufficiently expressed the evidence that he or she believes supports the automatic thought. 4. The automatic thought itself is also a core belief. 5. The patient understands intellectually that the automatic thought is distorted, but does not believe it on an emotional level. Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 177 In the first situation, the patient has not verbalized the most central automatic thought or image . John, for example, reports the thought, “If I try out [for the community basketball team], I probably won’t make it. ” Evaluating this thought does not significantly affect his dysphoria because he has other important (but unrecognized) thoughts: “What if they think I’m a lousy player? ” “What if I make stupid mistakes? ” He also has an image of the coach and other players watching him with mocking, scornful faces. In a second situation, the patient responds to an automatic thought super -ficially . John thinks, “I won’t finish all my work. I have too much to do. ” Instead of carefully evaluating the thought, John merely responds, “No, I’ll probably get it done. ” This response is insufficient, and his anxiety does not decrease. In a third situation, the therapist does not thoroughly probe for, and there -fore the patient does not fully express the evidence that his or her automatic thought is true , resulting in an ineffective adaptive response, as seen here:Th e r a p i s T: Okay, John, what evidence do you have that your sister doesn’t want to bother with you? pa Ti e n T: Well, she hardly ever calls me. I always call her. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, anything on the other side? That she does care about you, that she does want a good relationship with you? Had John’s therapist queried him further, he would have uncov -ered other evidence that John has to support his automatic thought: that his sister spent more time with her girlfriends during vacations than with John, that she sounded impatient on the phone when he called, and that she had not sent him a birthday card. Having elicited this additional data, the therapist could have helped John weigh the evidence more effectively and investigated alternative explanations for his sister’s behavior. In a fourth situation, the patient identifies an automatic thought that is also a core belief . John often thinks, “I’m incompetent. ” He believes this idea so strongly that a single evaluation does not alter his perception or the associated affect. His therapist needs to use many techniques over time to alter this belief (see Chapter 14). In a fifth situation, the patient indicates that he believes an adaptive response “intellectually, ” in his mind, but not “emotionally, ” in his heart, soul, or gut . He discounts the adaptive response. In this case, the therapist and patient need to explore an unarticulated belief that lies behind the automatic thought: 178 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: How much do you believe that it’s not your fault if you get laid off? pa Ti e n T: Well, I can see it intellectually. Th e r a p i s T: But? pa Ti e n T: Even though I know the economy is bad, I still think I should be able to hold on to my job. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, let’s assume for a moment that you do get laid off. What would be the worst part about that, or what would that mean? Here, John’s therapist discovers that he does not really believe the adap -tive response and uncovers an assumption: If I lose my job, it means I’m incompetent . To summarize, having evaluated an automatic thought, you ask patients to rate how much they believe the adaptive response and how they feel emotionally. If their belief is low and they are still distressed, you conceptualize why examining the thought did not alleviate their distress and plan a strategy for what to do next. USING Al TERNATE m ETHODS TO H El P PATIENTS Ex Am INE T HEIR T HINk INGIn lieu of or in addition to using the questions in Figure 11. 1, you can do the following:Vary your questions. • Identify the cognitive distortion. • Use self-disclosure. • These strategies are described below. Using Alternative Questions The following transcript is just one illustration of how to vary your ques -tions when you predict that standard questions will be ineffective. Th e r a p i s T: What went through your mind [when you asked your mom if it was all right with her to shorten your time together, and she sounded hurt and angry]? pa Ti e n T: That I should have known it was a bad time to call. I shouldn’t have called. Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 179 Th e r a p i s T: What’s the evidence that you shouldn’t have called? pa Ti e n T: Well, my mother is usually rushed in the morning. If I had waited until after she got home from work, she might have been in a better frame of mind. Th e r a p i s T: Had that occurred to you? pa Ti e n T: Well, yeah, but I wanted to let my friend know right away whether I could visit, so she could make plans. Th e r a p i s T: So you actually had a reason for calling when you did, and it sounds as if you knew it might be risky, but you really wanted to let your friend know as soon as you could? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: Is it reasonable to be so hard on yourself for taking the risk? pa Ti e n T: No . . . Th e r a p i s T: You don’t sound convinced. How bad is it anyway, in the scheme of things, for your mom to feel hurt that you want to spend one week of your summer vacation with your friend? I followed up these questions with others: How hurt did your mother feel? How long did the hurt last at that level? How does she probably feel now? Is it possible for you to spare your mother hurt all the time? Can you possibly do what is good for you and not hurt your mother at all, given that she wants to spend as much time with you as she can? Is it desirable to have a goal of never hurting someone else’s feelings? What would you have to give up yourself? The previous transcript demonstrates how to use nonstandard ques -tions to help patients adopt a more functional perspective. Although I started out questioning the validity of the thought, I shifted the empha -sis to the implicit underlying belief (which we had previously discussed in other contexts): “It’s bad to hurt other people’s feelings. ” At the end, I asked the patient an open-ended question (“How do you see the situa -tion now? ”) to see whether she needed more help in responding to her thoughts. Note that many questions I asked were a variation of Ques -tion 2 in Figure 11. 1: “Is there an alternative explanation [for why you called when you did and for why your mother was hurt, other than that you were bad and at fault]? ”Identifying Cognitive Distortions Patients tend to make consistent errors in their thinking. Often there is a systematic negative bias in the cognitive processing of patients who suffer from a psychiatric disorder (Beck, 1976). The most common 180 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND errors are presented in Figure 11. 2 (see also Burns, 1980). It often helps to label distortions and to teach patients to do the same. You might make mental notes of a patient’s common distortions and point out a specific distortion when you spot a pattern:Th e r a p i s T: Sally, this idea that you either get an “A” and you’re a suc -cess, or you don’t and you’re a failure—that’s what we call all-or-nothing thinking. Does it seem familiar? I remember you also thought that either you understood everything in a chapter, or you were stupid. Do you think it could be helpful to watch out for this kind of thinking? You can also provide patients with a list of distortions, such as the one in Figure 11. 2, if you judge that they will not be overwhelmed by it. At another session, I gave Sally the list, and together we identified her typical automatic thoughts and the distortions they represented. For example:Catastrophizing : “I’ll flunk out of school. ”All-or-nothing thinking : “If I can’t read the entire chapter, it’s not worth reading any of it. ”Mind reading : “My roommate doesn’t want to be bothered with me. ”Emotional reasoning : “I feel so incompetent. ”Sally kept this list handy and often referred to it when she was evalu -ating her automatic thoughts. Doing so helped her gain additional dis -tance from her thinking and allowed her to believe more strongly that perhaps an automatic thought was not true, or not completely true. Using Self-Disclosure At times, you might use judicious self-disclosure instead of or in addi -tion to Socratic questioning or other methods, to demonstrate how you were able to change similar automatic thoughts that you had, as illus -trated below:Th e r a p i s T: You know, Sally, sometimes I have thoughts like yours: “I have to make everyone happy. ” But then I remind myself that I have a responsibility to take care of myself, and that the world probably won’t end if someone is disappointed. ( pause ) Do you think that applies to you, too? Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 181 Although some automatic thoughts are true, many are either untrue or have just a grain of truth. Typical mistakes in thinking include: 1. All-or-nothing thinking (also called black-and-white, polarized, or dichotomous thinking): You view a situation in only two categories instead of on a continuum. Example: “If I’m not a total success, I’m a failure. ” 2. Catastrophizing (also called fortune-telling): You predict the future negatively without considering other, more likely outcomes. Example: “I’ll be so upset, I won’t be able to function at all. ” 3. Disqualifying or discounting the positive : You unreasonably tell yourself that positive experiences, deeds, or qualities do not count. Example: “I did that project well, but that doesn’t mean I’m competent; I just got lucky. ” 4. Emotional reasoning : You think something must be true because you “feel” (actually believe) it so strongly, ignoring or discounting evidence to the contrary. Example: “I know I do a lot of things okay at work, but I still feel like I’m a failure. ” 5. Labeling : You put a fixed, global label on yourself or others without considering that the evidence might more reasonably lead to a less disastrous conclusion. Example: “I’m a loser. He’s no good. ” 6. Magnification/minimization : When you evaluate yourself, another person, or a situation, you unreasonably magnify the negative and/or minimize the positive. Example: “Getting a mediocre evaluation proves how inadequate I am. Getting high marks doesn’t mean I’m smart. ” 7. Mental filter (also called selective abstraction): You pay undue attention to one negative detail instead of seeing the whole picture. Example: “Because I got one low rating on my evaluation [which also contained several high ratings] it means I’m doing a lousy job. ” 8. Mind reading : You believe you know what others are thinking, failing to consider other, more likely possibilities. Example: “He thinks that I don’t know the first thing about this project. ” (cont. )FIGURE 11. 2. Thinking errors. Adapted with permission from Aaron T. Beck. 182 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND WHEN A UTO m ATIC T HOUGHTS A RE T RUESometimes automatic thoughts turn out to be true, and you may choose to do one or more of the following:focus on problem solving. • Investigate whether the patient has drawn • an invalid or dysfunctional conclusion. Work on acceptance. • These strategies are described below. Focus on Problem Solving Not all problems can be solved, but if a patient’s perception of a situa -tion appears to be valid, you might investigate whether the problem can be solved, at least to some degree. In the transcript below, Sally and I have evaluated her automatic thought, “I’m going to run out of money, ” and the evidence seems clear that this is a valid perception. 9. Overgeneralization : You make a sweeping negative conclusion that goes far beyond the current situation. Example: “[Because I felt uncomfortable at the meeting] I don’t have what it takes to make friends. ”10. Personalization : You believe others are behaving negatively because of you, without considering more plausible explanations for their behavior. Example: “The repairman was curt to me because I did something wrong. ”11. “Should” and “must” statements (also called imperatives): You have a precise, fixed idea of how you or others should behave, and you overestimate how bad it is that these expectations are not met. Example: “It’s terrible that I made a mistake. I should always do my best. ”12. Tunnel vision : You only see the negative aspects of a situation. Example: “ my son’s teacher can’t do anything right. He’s critical and insensitive and lousy at teaching. ”FIGURE 11. 2. (cont. ) Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 183 Th e r a p i s T: So even if you’re careful, it looks as if you won’t be able to come up with rent toward the end of the school year . . . Have you already tried to do something about this? pa Ti e n T: No, not really. I don’t want to ask my parents for more. They’re pretty strapped as it is. Th e r a p i s T: But you might be able to use them as a last resort? pa Ti e n T: Maybe . . . Th e r a p i s T: Have you thought of anything else? pa Ti e n T: No, I don’t think there’s anything else I can do. Th e r a p i s T: Have you talked to the dean of students? pa Ti e n T: I hadn’t thought of that. Th e r a p i s T: Quite possibly he could help. I imagine there are other stu -dents who are also struggling financially. He might suggest another student loan, or a payment plan, or maybe there’s some emergency fund you could tap into. pa Ti e n T: I hope so. Th e r a p i s T: Well, do you want to start with the dean? If that doesn’t work out, we can brainstorm other ideas: getting a job, moving in with someone else, borrowing from another relative . . . There might be lots of things that you could do that you haven’t thought of because you’ve been so depressed. Investigate Invalid Conclusions While an automatic thought might be true, the meaning may be invalid or at least not completely valid (as illustrated below), and you can exam -ine the underlying belief or conclusion. Th e r a p i s T: So it looks as if you really did hurt your friend’s feelings. pa Ti e n T: Yeah, I feel so bad about it. Th e r a p i s T: What does it mean about you that you hurt her feelings? Or what are you afraid will happen? pa Ti e n T: I should never have said that to her. I’m a terrible friend . . . I’m a terrible person! She’ll never want to talk to me again! Th e r a p i s T: Okay, can we look at that first? What other evidence do you have that you’re a terrible person? . . . Is there evidence on the other side, that maybe you’re not? 184 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Work toward Acceptance Some problems cannot be solved and may never be solved, and patients need help in accepting that outcome. They may continue to feel miser -able if they have unrealistic expectations or hopes that an unresolvable problem will somehow, almost magically, improve. Meanwhile, they need assistance in learning to focus on their core values, emphasize the more rewarding parts of their lives, and enrich their experience in new ways. A number of strategies designed to enhance acceptance can be found in Hayes and colleagues (2004). TEACHING P ATIENTS TO E VAl UATE T HEIR T HINk INGAt some point, you may give a copy of the questions in Figure 11. 1 to the patient. You could do so immediately following the part of a session in which you have verbally asked these questions. Or you would wait until a later time if your questioning was not very effective, if you don’t have enough time to review Figure 11. 1 with the patient, or if you think the patient would be overwhelmed. Many patients do better if you teach them just one or two questions, writing them on a separate piece of paper. You can give the full list to other patients and just mark the ques -tions as you review them. Learning to evaluate automatic thoughts is a skill. Some patients grasp it right away; others need much repeated, guided practice in a graded fashion. For example, one patient might be helped with a variation of the “evidence” question: “How do I know this thought is true? ” Another patient who often catastrophizes might do better with a variation of the “decatastrophizing” question: “If the worst happens, how would I cope? What are the best and most realistic outcomes? ” Still another patient might find it most useful to answer the “distanc -ing” question: “If [my sister-in-law] were in this situation and had this thought, what would I tell her? ”When patients seem ready to learn this skill, select an automatic thought for which most of the questions in Figure 11. 1 are likely to apply. Following an examination of one of Sally’s automatic thoughts, I point out the process to her:Th e r a p i s T: If you’re like most people, you may find that using these questions at home is sometimes harder than it looks. In fact, there will be lots of times when we really need to work together to help you examine a thought. But give it a try, and if you have trouble we can talk about it next week. Okay? Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 185 Predicting that patients may have some difficulty can help allay self-criticism or defeatism if the assignment doesn’t go smoothly. Had I suspected, despite my admonition, that Sally would judge herself harshly for not being able to fulfill the homework assignment perfectly, I would have pursued the subject more thoroughly:Th e r a p i s T: Sally, if you do have trouble evaluating your thoughts this week, how are you likely to feel? pa Ti e n T: Frustrated, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: What’s likely to go through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. I’ll probably just quit. Th e r a p i s T: Can you imagine looking at the sheet of paper and not being able to figure out what to do? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: What’s going through your mind as you look at the paper? pa Ti e n T: “I should be able to do this. I’m so stupid. ”Th e r a p i s T: Good! Do you think it would help to have a written reminder that it’s just a skill you’ll get better at as you learn more and more here with me? pa Ti e n T: Yes. ( Writes it in her therapy notes . )Th e r a p i s T: Do you think this response will help enough? Or do you think we should put off this assignment until we have more time to practice together? pa Ti e n T: No. I think I can try it. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, now if you do get frustrated and have automatic thoughts, be sure to jot them down. Okay? Here I make the assignment into a no-lose proposition: Either Sally does it successfully, or she has some difficulty that I can help her with at the next session. If frustrated, she either reads her therapy notes (and probably feels better), or keeps track of her thoughts so she can learn to respond to them in the next session. TAk ING A S HORTCUT : NOT U SING THE Q UESTIONS AT All Finally, when patients have progressed in therapy and can automati -cally evaluate their thoughts, you may sometimes just ask them to devise an adaptive response . 186 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: [When I get ready to ask my roommate to keep the kitchen neater] I’ll probably think I should just clean it better myself. Th e r a p i s T: Can you think of a more helpful way to view this? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. That it’s better for me to stand up for myself. That I’m doing something reasonable. I’m not being mean or asking her to do more than her share. That she’ll probably take it okay, like she did the last time I asked her to clean up. Th e r a p i s T: Good. What do you think will happen to your anxiety if you say that to yourself? pa Ti e n T: It’ll go down. Here’s another example:Th e r a p i s T: Anything you can think of that might get in the way of your starting the chemistry assignment? pa Ti e n T: I might think there’s too much to do and get overwhelmed. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, if you do have the thought, “There’s too much to do, ” what can you tell yourself? pa Ti e n T: That I don’t have to do it all in one night, that I don’t have to understand it perfectly this first time through. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Will that be enough, do you think, to go ahead and start the assignment? Evaluating automatic thoughts is a specific skill, one at which both therapists and patients improve with repeated practice. The next chapter describes how to help patients respond to their automatic thoughts. 187 Chapter 12 RESPONDING TO AUTOm ATIC THOUGHTSThe previous chapter demonstrated how to help patients evaluate important automatic thoughts and determine the effectiveness of their evaluation in session. This chapter describes how to facilitate patients’ evaluation of and response to automatic thoughts between ses-sions . Patients experience two kinds of automatic thoughts outside of session: ones they have already identifi ed and evaluated in session, and novel cognitions. For the former group, you will ensure that patients have recorded robust responses in writing (on paper or an index card, in a therapy notebook, or on a smartphone) or in an audio format (on an audiotape or CD, in a recorded message on their phone, etc. ). To respond to novel automatic thoughts between sessions, you will teach patients to use the list of questions in Figure 11. 1 (either mentally or in writing), or to use a worksheet such as the Thought Record in Fig-ure 12. 1 or an easier version, the “Testing Your Thoughts” Worksheet in Figure 12. 2. But there are other ways to respond to automatic thoughts. Patients can engage in problem solving, use distraction or relaxation techniques, or label and accept their thoughts and emotions without evaluation. 188 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND REVIEWING T HERAPY N OTESHaving evaluated an automatic thought with patients (usually through Socratic questioning), you will ask them to summarize. For example, you might pose one of the following questions:“Can you summarize what we’ve just been talking about? ”“What do you think would be important for you to remember this week? ”“If the situation comes up again, what do you wish you could tell yourself? ”When patients express a cogent summary, you can ask them if they would like to record it, so they can better remember the response when similar automatic thoughts arise in the future. In the following tran -script, Sally and I have just evaluated her thought “I can’t do it, ” using many of the questions in Figure 11. 1 (page 172). I ask her to summa -rize. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, Sally, so if you open your chemistry text this week and again have the thought “I can’t do it, ” what do you want to remind yourself? pa Ti e n T: That it’s probably not true. That I can probably do at least some of it, because I have in the past, and I can get help if I don’t understand all of it. I guess doing part of the reading is better than not doing any at all. Th e r a p i s T: That’s good. Should we record that? Q: What if . . . patients’ responses are superficial, confused, or too wordy? A: You might say, “Well, I think that’s close, but I wonder if it would be more helpful to remember it this way . . . ” If their answers are reasonable but incomplete, you might ask, “Do you also want to remind yourself that. . . ? ” If they agree, you or they can record your suggestions. It is desirable to have patients read their therapy notes each morn -ing and pull them out, as needed, during the day. Patients tend to inte -grate responses into their thinking when they have rehearsed them repeatedly. Reading notes only when encountering difficult situations Responding to Automatic Thoughts 189 is usually less effective than reading them regularly in preparation for dif -ficult situations. Below are some of Sally’s therapy notes. They contain:Responses to dysfunctional thinking, • Behavioral assignments, or• A combination of responses and • behavioral assignments. When I think “I’ll never get all my work done, ” remind myself: I just need to focus on what I need to do right now. I don’t have to do everything perfectly. I can ask for help. It’s not a sign of weakness. When I think “I’d rather stay in bed, ” tell myself that I alwaysfeel a little better when I get something done and worse when I do nothing. 190 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND It might feel as if no one cares about me, but that’s not true. My family, Allison, and Joe do. It’s harder to feel their caring, but that’s because I’m depressed. The best thing to do is to stayin touch with them, so go call or text them. When I want to ask the professor for help 1. Remind myself it’s no big deal. The worst that’ll happen is he’ll act gruff. 2. Remember, this is an experiment. Even if it doesn’t work this time, it’s good practice for me. 3. If he is gruff, it probably has nothing to do with me. He may be busy or irritated by something else. 4. Even if he won’t help me, so what? It’s his failure as a professor, not mine as a student. It means he isn’t doing his job properly. I can ask the department for a tutor, or ask someone else in the class to help. 5. So I should go knock on his door. At worst, it’ll be good practice. Responding to Automatic Thoughts 191 Strategies for when I’m anxious 1. Do a Thought Record. 2. Read coping cards. 3. Call [friend]. 4. Go for a walk or run. 5. Tolerate the anxiety. It’s an unpleasant feeling but it’s not life threatening, and it will decrease once I turn my attention to something else. On a practical note, you should keep copies of your patients’ therapy notes, photocopying them or using carbonless paper. You will probably find that you refer back to these therapy notes often, especially when reviewing patients’ homework or reinforcing ideas you had discussed with patients in prior sessions. Also, a certain number of patients lose their notes and benefit greatly from a photocopy of your copy. Audio-Recorded Therapy Notes Ensuring that patients have written therapy notes is ideal. They can carry around a notebook or index cards to read as needed, or they can read their therapy notes on their smartphone. But some patients cannot or do not like to read. Or they find listening to notes to be more effective. In any case, you can turn on an audio recorder or have patients push the record button on their phone when you and they develop responses to automatic thoughts; or you can note what the responses are and turn on the recorder for the last few minutes of a session, recording all responses at once. Recording and then having patients listen to an entire therapy session is usually not as useful. They are likely to listen to the recording only once during the week, instead of repeatedly listening to the most important points of the session. Motivating patients to read therapy notes is similar to facilitating their doing any kind of homework (see Chapter 17). Initially, it is use-ful to have patients read their therapy notes at the end of a session and have them note that it takes less than a minute. When patients cannot read therapy notes, they may be able to listen to an audiotaped sum-mary or find someone in their environment who can read the notes to them. 192 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND EVAl UATING AND R ESPONDING TO N OVE l AUTO m ATIC T HOUGHTS BETWEEN S ESSIONSThe previous chapter provided a list of Socratic questions patients can ask themselves to evaluate their thinking. Before suggesting that they use these questions at home when they feel upset, you will make sure that:They understand that evaluating their thinking can • help them feel better. They believe they will be able to use the questions • effectively at home. They understand that not all questions apply to all • automatic thoughts. You have shortened the list for patients who find • the entire list daunting or overwhelming. You also guide them as to when and how to use the questions, as I did with Sally:Th e r a p i s T: Sally, it would be too burdensome for you to use these questions for every automatic thought you have this week. That’s one reason that you have therapy notes to read every morning and as needed during the day. But when you notice your mood getting worse and you catch your automatic thoughts, think to yourself, “Do I have therapy notes that cover this? ” Okay? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: If you do, you have a choice. Use these questions or pull out your notes. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: If you don’t have notes, then you definitely will want to pull out the list at least some of the time. Now, ideally, you’d not only ask yourself the questions, but you’d also write down your answers, if you can. How does that sound? pa Ti e n T: Fine. Thought Records The Thought Record (TR), also known in an earlier version as the Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts (Beck et al. , 1979), is a work - Responding to Automatic Thoughts 193 sheet that prompts patients to evaluate their automatic thoughts when they feel distressed (see Figure 12. 1). It elicits more information than just responding to the questions in Figure 11. 1. It is not necessary for patients to use the TR if these questions are helpful, but many patients find the worksheet organizes their thinking and responses better. (The TR is not particularly useful, however, for patients who are low func -tioning, dislike writing, are unmotivated, or not well enough equipped intellectually to benefit from it. ) You might first use the list of questions in Figure 11. 1 (page 172) with patients, then show them how to write the answers and other information on a Thought Record. In the following section, Sally and I have used the list of Socratic questions to evaluate her thought “Bob won’t want to go with me, ” and she feels better. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Now I’d like to show you a worksheet that I think will help you at home, if that’s okay. It’s called a Thought Record—and it’s just an organized way of writing down what we just did. Okay? ( Pulls out Figure 12. 1 . )pa Ti e n T: Sure. Th e r a p i s T: Here it is. Now, before I start, I have to tell you a couple of things. First, spelling, handwriting, and grammar don’t count. Second, this is a useful tool, and it may take some practice for you to get really good at it. So expect to make some mistakes along the way. These mistakes will actually be useful—we’ll see what was con -fusing, so you can do it better the next time. Okay? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: Here’s how you’ll know when you should pull it out ( point -ing to the top of the sheet ). Do you see here at the top? It says, “Direc -tions: When you notice your mood getting worse, ask yourself, ‘What’s going through my mind right now? ’ and as soon as possible jot down the thought or mental image in the Automatic Thought column. ”pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: Now, let’s look at the columns. The directions are at the top of each. The first column is easy. When did you have that thought about Bob? pa Ti e n T: Friday afternoon, after class. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. You can write that in the first column. pa Ti e n T: (Does so . )Th e r a p i s T: Now, you’ll see the second column prompts you to write down the situation. So you could put, “Thinking about asking Bob 194 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND if he wants to have coffee. ”( Pauses while Sally writes . ) Now, the third column is for your automatic thoughts and how much you believe them. Here’s where you write down the actual words or pictures that went through your mind. In this case, you had the thought, “He won’t want to go with me. ” How much did you believe the thought at that time? pa Ti e n T: A lot, maybe 90%. Th e r a p i s T: Good. You could write “90%” next to your thought, or “a lot. ” And in the fourth column, you write your emotion and how intense it was. In this case, how sad did you feel? pa Ti e n T: Pretty sad—75%. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, write that down. ( Waits for Sally to finish writing . ) Next, look at the fifth column. It tells you to identify the cognitive distortion. Can you look at your list and tell me if you think your automatic thought falls into one of those categories? pa Ti e n T: I think it’s fortune telling or mind reading. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Actually, it’s both. Next, column five tells you to use the questions at the bottom. Do you want to write down the answers we just went over? pa Ti e n T: Okay. ( Does so . )Th e r a p i s T: Now, the last column tells us how helpful this was. How much do you now believe the automatic thought? pa Ti e n T: Less. Maybe 50%. Th e r a p i s T: And how sad are you feeling? pa Ti e n T: Less. About 50%, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: So you can write that down. pa Ti e n T: (Does so . )Th e r a p i s T: I want you to remember what I told you before. Don’t expect all your negative emotion to go away. But if doing a Thought Record helps a little, even 10%, it was worth doing. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: So what do you think of the Thought Record? Do you want to try it this week at home? pa Ti e n T: Yes, I will. For some patients, it is better to introduce the Thought Record in two stages. In one session, you might teach patients to fill in the first four columns. If they successfully do so for homework, you can then teach them to use the final two columns. 195 Directions: When you notice your mood getting worse, ask yourself, “What’s going through my mind right now? ” and as soon as possible jot down the thought or mental image in the Automatic Thought(s) column. Date/Time Situation Automatic Thought(s) Emotion(s) Adaptive Response Outcome 1. What actual event or stream of thoughts, or daydreams or recollection led to the unpleasant emotion? 2. What (if any) distressing physical sensations did you have? 1. What thought(s) and/or image(s) went through your mind? 2. How much did you believe each one at the time? 1. What emotion(s) (sad/anxious/angry/etc. ) did you feel at the time? 2. How intense (0–100%) was the emotion? 1. (optional) What cognitive distortion did you make? 2. Use questions at bottom to compose a response to the automatic thought(s). 3. How much do you believe each response? 1. How much do you now believe each automatic thought? 2. What emotion(s) do you feel now? How intense (0–100%) is the emotion? 3. What will you do (or did you do)? Friday 3/83 P . M. Thinking about asking Bob if he wants to have coffee. He won’t want to go with me. (90%)Sad (75%) (Fortune telling and mind reading)I don’t really know if he wants to or not. (90%)He is friendly to me in class. (90%)The worst that’ll happen is he’ll say no and I’ll feel bad for a while, but I could go talk to Allison about it. (90%)The best is he’ll say yes. (100%)The most realistic is he may say he’s busy but still act friendly. (80%)If I keep on assuming he doesn’t want to go with me, I won’t ask him at all. (100%)I should just go up and ask him. (50%)What’s the big deal, anyway? (75%)1. AT (50%)2. Sad (50%)3. I'll ask him. Questions to help compose an alternative response: (1) What is the evidence that the automatic thought is true? Not true? (2) Is there an alternative explanation? (3) What’s the worst that could happen? How could I cope? What’s the best that could happen? What’s the most realistic outcome? (4) What’s the effect of my believing the automatic thought? What could be the effect of my changing my thinking? (5) What should I do about it? (6) If [friend’s name] was in the situation and had this thought, what would I tell him/her? FIGURE 12. 1. Thought Record. From Cognitive behavior therapy worksheet packet . Copyright 2011 by Judith S. Beck. Bala Cynwyd, PA: Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy. 196 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND “Testing Your Thoughts” Worksheet When you predict that the Thought Record could be too confusing or elaborate for patients, you can consider using a simplified version, the “Testing Your Thoughts” Worksheet (Figure 12. 2). It contains similar questions, is worded at a lower readability level, and its more structured format is easier to complete. FIGURE 12. 2. “Testing Your Thoughts” Worksheet. From Cognitive behavior therapy worksheet packet . Copyright 2011 by Judith S. Beck. Bala Cynwyd, PA: Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy. What is the situation? Joanne yelled at me. What am I thinking or imagining? She’ll never call me again. What makes me think the thought is true? She seemed pretty mad. What makes me think the thought is not true or not completely true? She’s gotten mad at me before, but she seems to get over it. What’s another way to look at this? She’s got a real temper, but she doesn’t stay mad. What’s the worst that could happen? What could I do then? I’d lose my best friend. I would have to concentrate on my other friends. What’s the best that could happen? She’ll call back right away and apologize. What will probably happen? She’ll act kind of cold for a few days, but then I’ll call her. What will happen if I keep telling myself the same thought? I’ll keep being really upset. What could happen if I changed my thinking? I could feel better, maybe call her sooner. What would I tell my friend [think of a specific person] E m i l y if this happened to him or her? Don’t worry, just wait 2 days and call. Responding to Automatic Thoughts 197 When a Worksheet Is Not Sufficiently Helpful As with any technique in cognitive behavior therapy, it is important not to overemphasize the importance of worksheets. Most patients, at some point, find that completing a particular worksheet did not provide much relief. If you emphasize its general usefulness and “stuck points” as an opportunity for learning, you help patients avoid automatic thoughts critical of themselves, the therapy, the worksheet, or you. As described in the previous chapter, evaluation of an automatic thought (with or without a worksheet) may be less than optimal if patients fail to respond to their most upsetting thought or image, if their automatic thought is a core belief or activated an underlying belief, if their evaluation and response are superficial, or if they dis -count their response. RESPONDING TO A UTO m ATIC T HOUGHTS IN O THER W AYSSometimes you will use other methods to respond to automatic thoughts. For example, when patients have anxious, obsessive thoughts, you may teach them the “AWARE” technique (Beck & Emery, 1985) in which patients practice:A: Accepting their anxiety. W: Watching their anxiety without judgment. A: Acting with their anxiety, as if they aren’t anxious. R: Repeating the first three steps. E: Expecting the best. When patients’ emotions are too high to effectively use their execu -tive function to evaluate their thoughts, you might use distraction or relaxation techniques, described in Chapter 15. 198 Chapter 13 IDENTIf YING AND m ODIf YING INTERm EDIATE BEl IEf SPrevious chapters described the identifi cation and modifi cation of automatic thoughts, the actual words or images that go through a patient’s mind in a given situation and lead to distress. This chapter and the next describe the deeper, often unarticulated ideas or under-standings that patients have about themselves, others, and their per-sonal worlds, that give rise to specifi c automatic thoughts. These ideas often are not expressed before therapy but can easily be elicited from the patient, or inferred and then tested. As described in Chapter 3, these beliefs may be classifi ed in two categories: intermediate beliefs (composed of rules, attitudes, and assumptions) and core beliefs (rigid, global ideas about oneself, others, or the world). Intermediate beliefs, while not as easily modifi able as automatic thoughts, are still more malleable than core beliefs. This chapter is divided into two parts. In the fi rst part, cognitive conceptualization (initially introduced in Chapter 3) is described, and the process of developing a Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram is illustrated. Conceptualization is emphasized throughout this volume to help the therapist plan therapy, become adept at choosing appropriate interventions, and overcome stuck points when standard interventions fail. Eliciting and modifying intermediate beliefs are the focus of the second part of this chapter. These techniques also apply to the next chapter, which presents additional specialized techniques for eliciting and mod-ifying core beliefs. Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 199 COGNITIVE C ONCEPTUA l Iz ATIONGenerally, you will guide patients to work on automatic thoughts before directly modifying their beliefs. From the beginning, though, you start formulating a conceptualization, which logically connects automatic thoughts to the deeper-level beliefs. If you fail to see this larger picture, you will be less likely to direct therapy in an effective, efficient way. You can start filling out a Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram (Figures 13. 1 and 13. 2) after the first session with a patient, if you have collected data in the form of the cognitive model (the bottom part of the diagram); that is, you have data about the patient’s typical automatic thoughts, emotions, behavior, and/or beliefs. This diagram depicts, among other things, the relationship between core beliefs, intermedi -ate beliefs, and current automatic thoughts. It provides a cognitive map of the patient’s psychopathology and helps organize the multitude of data that the patient presents. The diagram in Figure 13. 1 illustrates the basic questions you will ask yourself to complete the diagram. When filling in data after the initial session, you should regard your first efforts as tentative; you have not yet collected enough data to determine the extent to which the automatic thoughts patients have expressed are very typical for them. The completed diagram will mis -lead you if you choose situations in which the themes of patients’ auto -matic thoughts are not part of an overall pattern. After three or four sessions, you should be able to complete the bottom half with more confidence, as patterns should have emerged. You share your partial conceptualization with patients verbally (and sometimes on a blank piece of paper) at every session as you sum -marize their experience in the form of the cognitive model. Generally you will not share the worksheet, however, as many patients would find it confusing (or occasionally demeaning if they interpret the diagram as your attempt to “fit” them into boxes). Initially, you may have data to complete only a portion of the dia -gram. You either leave the other boxes blank, or fill in items you have inferred with a question mark to indicate their tentative status. You will check out missing or inferred items with the patient at future ses -sions. At some point you will share both the top and bottom parts of the conceptualization, when your goal for a session is to help patients understand the broader picture of their difficulties. At that time, you will review the conceptualization verbally, share a simplified version on a blank sheet of paper, or (for patients whom you judge will ben -efit) present a blank conceptualization diagram and fill it out together. Whenever you present your interpretations, you will do so tentatively and label them as hypotheses, asking patients whether they “ring true. ” Correct hypotheses generally resonate with the patient. 200 Reprinted by permission in Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Basics and Beyond, Second Edition , by Judith S.

Which behaviors help him/her cope with the belief(s)? Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 201 Usually it is best to start with the bottom half of the conceptu -alization diagram. You jot down three typical situations in which the patient became upset. Then, for each situation, fill in the key automatic thought, its meaning, and the patient’s subsequent emotion and rel -evant behavior (if any). If you have not directly asked patients for the meaning of their automatic thoughts, you either hypothesize (with a written question mark) or, better still, do the downward arrow tech -nique (pages 206–208) at the next session to uncover the meaning for each thought. The meaning of the automatic thought for each situation should be logically connected with the Core Belief box near the top of the diagram. For example, Sally’s diagram (Figure 13. 2) clearly shows how her automatic thoughts, and the meaning of those thoughts are related to her core belief of incompetence. To complete the top box of the diagram, ask yourself (and the patient): How did the core belief originate and become maintained? What life events (especially those in childhood) did the patient experi -ence that might be related to the development and maintenance of the belief? Typical relevant childhood data include such significant events as continual or periodic strife among parents or other family members; parental divorce; negative interactions with parents, siblings, teachers, peers, or others in which the child felt blamed, criticized, or otherwise devalued; serious illness; death of significant others; physical or sexual abuse; and other adverse life conditions, such as moving frequently, experiencing trauma, growing up in poverty, or facing chronic discrim -ination, to name a few. The relevant childhood data may, however, be more subtle: for example, children’s perceptions (which may or may not have been valid) that they did not measure up in important ways to their siblings; that they were different from or demeaned by peers; that they did not meet expectations of parents, teachers, or others; or that their parents favored a sibling over them. Next ask yourself, “How did the patient cope with this painful core belief? Which intermediate beliefs (i. e. , underlying assumptions, rules, and attitudes) has the patient developed? ”Sally’s beliefs are depicted hierarchically in Figure 13. 3. As Sally has many intermediate beliefs that could be classified as attitudes or rules, it is particularly useful to list the key assumptions in the box below the core belief. (See page 211 on how you can help a patient re-express an attitude or rule as an assumption. ) Sally, for example, developed an assumption that helped her cope with the painful idea of incom -petence: “If I work very hard, then I can do okay. ” Like most patients, she also had the flip side of the same assumption: “If I don’t work hard, then I’ll fail. ” Most Axis I patients tend to operate according to the first 202 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Situation 1 Automatic Thought Meaning of the A.

Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 203 assumption, the one phrased in a more positive way, until they become psychologically distressed, at which time the negative assumption sur -faces. Note that the designation “positive” does not necessarily mean the belief is adaptive. To complete the next box, “coping strategies, ” you ask yourself, “Which behavioral strategies did the patient develop to cope with the painful core belief? ” Note that the patient’s broad assumptions often link the coping strategies to the core belief:“If I [engage in the coping strategy], then [my core belief may not come true; I’ll be okay]. However, if I [do not engage in my coping strategy], then [my core belief is likely to come true]. ”Sally’s strategies were to develop high standards for herself, work very hard, overprepare for exams and presentations, remain vigilant for her shortcomings, and avoid seeking help (especially in situations in which asking for assistance could, in her mind, expose her incompe -tence). She believes that engaging in these behaviors will protect her from failure and the exposure of her incompetence (and that not doing them could lead to failure and exposure of incompetence). Another patient might have developed strategies that are the opposite of Sally’s behaviors: avoiding hard work, developing few goals, underpreparing, and asking for excessive help. Why did Sally develop a particular set of coping strategies while a second patient developed I’m incompetent. Core belief It’s terrible to be incompetent. If I work extra hard, I can do okay. If I don’t work hard, I’ll fail. 1. Attitude:2. Assumptions:Intermediatebeliefs I can’t do this. This is too hard. I’ll never learn all this. Automatic thoughtswhen depressed FIGURE 13. 3. Sally’s hierarchy of beliefs and automatic thoughts. 204 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND the opposite set? Perhaps nature endowed them with different cogni -tive and behavioral styles; in interaction with the environment they developed different intermediate beliefs that reinforced their particu -lar behavioral strategies. The second patient, perhaps because of his childhood experiences, had the same core belief of incompetence, but coped with it by developing a different set of beliefs: “If I set low goals for myself I’ll be okay, but if I set high goals I’ll fail. ” “If I rely on others I’ll be okay, but if I rely on myself I’ll fail. ”Note that most coping strategies are normal behaviors that every -one engages in at times. The difficulty of patients in distress lies in the overuse of these strategies at the expense of more functional strategies. Figure 13. 4 lists a few examples of strategies that patients develop to cope with painful core beliefs. To summarize, the Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram is based on data patients present, their actual words. You should regard your hypotheses as tentative until confirmed by the patient. You will continu -ally reevaluate and refine the diagram as you collect additional data, and your conceptualization is not complete until the patient terminates treatment. While you might not show the actual diagram to patients, you will verbally (and often on paper) conceptualize their experience from the first session on, to help them make sense of their current reac -tions to situations. At some point, you will present the larger picture to patients so they can understand:FIGURE 13. 4. Typical coping strategies. Avoid negative emotion Display high emotion (e. g. , to attract attention)Try to be perfect Purposely appear incompetent or helpless Be overly responsible Avoid responsibility Avoid intimacy Seek inappropriate intimacy Seek recognition Avoid attention Avoid confrontation Provoke others Try to control situations Abdicate control to others Act childlike Act in an authoritarian manner Try to please others Distance self from others or try to please only oneself Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 205 How their earlier experiences contributed to the development • of core beliefs about themselves, their worlds, and others. How they developed certain assumptions or rules for living to • help them cope with their painful core beliefs. How these assumptions led to the development of particular • coping strategies or patterns of behavior that may (or may not) have been adaptive at the time but are no longer adaptive in many situations. Some patients are intellectually and emotionally ready to see the larger picture early on in therapy; you should wait to present it to others (espe -cially those with whom you do not have a sound therapeutic relation -ship, or who do not really believe in the cognitive model). As mentioned previously, whenever you present your conceptualization, ask the patient for confirmation, disconfirmation, or modification of each part. Identifying Intermediate and Core Beliefs You will identify intermediate beliefs by:1. Recognizing when a belief is expressed as an automatic thought. 2. Providing the first part of an assumption. 3. Directly eliciting a rule or attitude. 4. Using the downward arrow technique. 5. Examining the patient’s automatic thoughts and looking for common themes. 6. Asking the patient directly. 7. Reviewing a belief questionnaire completed by the patient. These strategies are illustrated below. 1. First, a patient may actually articulate a belief as an automatic thought, especially when depressed. Th e r a p i s T: What went through your mind when you got the quiz back? pa Ti e n T: I should have done better. I can’t do anything right. I’m so incompetent. [core belief] 206 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND 2. Second, you may be able to elicit a full assumption by providing the first half of it. Th e r a p i s T: So you had the thought “I’ll have to stay up all night work -ing. ”pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: And if you don’t work as hard as you possibly can on a paper or a project. . . ? pa Ti e n T: Then I haven’t done my best. I’ve failed. Th e r a p i s T: Does this sound familiar, based on what we’ve talked about before in therapy? Is this generally how you view your efforts, that if you don’t work as hard as you can, then you’ve failed? pa Ti e n T: Yes, I think so. Th e r a p i s T: Can you give me some more examples so we can see how widespread this belief is? Q: What if . . . patients have difficulty providing the second part of the assumption? A: Rephrase the question. Th e r a p i s T: Let me ask you about it this way: If you don’t work as hard as you possibly can on a paper or project, what bad thing could happen? Or what bad thing would it mean? 3. Third, you can identify a rule or an attitude by direct elicita -tion. Th e r a p i s T: So it’s pretty important to you to do really well in your vol -unteer tutoring job? pa Ti e n T: Oh, yes. Th e r a p i s T: Do you remember our talking about this kind of thing before, having to do very well? Do you have a rule about that? pa Ti e n T: Oh . . . I hadn’t really thought of it . . . I guess I have to do whatever I do really well. 4. More often, you will use a fourth technique to identify interme -diate (and core) beliefs: the downward arrow technique (Burns, 1980). Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 207 First, you identify a key automatic thought that you suspect may stem directly from a dysfunctional belief. Then you ask the patient for the meaning of this cognition, assuming the automatic thought is true. Con -tinue to do so until you have uncovered one or more important beliefs. Asking what a thought means to the patient often elicits an intermedi -ate belief; asking what it means about the patient usually uncovers the core belief. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, to summarize, you were studying late last night, you were looking over your class notes, you had the thought, “These notes make no sense, ” and you felt sad. pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, now we haven’t yet looked at the evidence to see if you’re right. But I’d like to see if we can figure out why that thought made you feel so sad. To do that, we have to assume for a moment that you are right, your notes don’t make sense. What would that mean to you? pa Ti e n T: I didn’t do a very good job in class. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, if it’s true that you didn’t do a very good job in class, what would that mean? pa Ti e n T: I’m a lousy student. [The assumption is, “If I don’t do a good job in school, it means I’m a lousy student. ”]Th e r a p i s T: Okay, if you’re a lousy student, what does that mean about you? pa Ti e n T: [core belief] I’m not good enough. [I am incompetent. ]Sometimes you can get stuck in the course of a downward arrow technique when the patient answers with a “feeling” response, such as “That would be terrible, ” or “I’d be so anxious. ” As in the example below, you will gently empathize, and then try to get back on track. To minimize the possibility that the patient will react negatively to your probing, you will provide a rationale for your repeated questioning and vary your inquiry through questions such as the following:“If that’s true, so what? ”“What’s so bad about . . . ”“What’s the worst part about . . . ”“What does that mean about you ? ” 208 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND The transcript below demonstrates the provision of a brief ratio -nale and the variation of questions in the downward arrow technique. Th e r a p i s T: It’s important for us to understand what part of this is most upsetting to you. What would it mean if your roommate and friends did get better grades than you? pa Ti e n T: Oh, I couldn’t stand it. Th e r a p i s T: So you’d be pretty upset, but what would be the worst part about it? pa Ti e n T: They’d probably look down on me. Th e r a p i s T: And if they did look down on you, what would be so bad about that? pa Ti e n T: I’d hate that. Th e r a p i s T: Sure, you’d be distressed if that happened. But so what if they looked down on you? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. That would be pretty bad. Th e r a p i s T: Would it mean something about you , if they looked down on you? pa Ti e n T: That I’m inferior, not as good as they are. [The assumption is “If people look down on me, it means I’m inferior. ” The core belief is “I’m inferior. ”]How do you know when to stop the downward arrow technique? Generally you have uncovered the important intermediate beliefs and/or core belief when the patient shows a negative shift in affect, and/or begins to state the belief in the same or similar words. Th e r a p i s T: And what would it mean if you are inferior and not as good as they are? pa Ti e n T: Just that, I’m inferior. 5. A fifth way to identify beliefs is to look for common themes in a patient’s automatic thoughts across situations. You can ask insightful patients whether they can identify a recurrent theme or you can make a hypothesis about a belief and ask the patient to reflect on its validity:Th e r a p i s T: Sally, in a number of situations you seem to think, “I can’t do it, ” or “It’s too hard, ” or “I won’t be able to get it done. ” I wonder whether you believe that you are somehow incompetent or inad -equate? pa Ti e n T: Yes, I think I do. I do think I’m incompetent. Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 2096. A sixth way to identify beliefs is to ask the patient directly. Some patients are able to articulate their beliefs fairly easily. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, what is your belief about asking for help? pa Ti e n T: Oh, asking for help is a sign of weakness. 7. Finally, a patient may be asked to complete a belief question -naire, such as the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (Weissman & Beck, 1978) or the Personality Belief Questionnaire (A. T. Beck & Beck, 1991). Careful review of items that are strongly endorsed can highlight problematic beliefs. The use of such questionnaires is a useful adjunct to the techniques described above. To summarize, you can identify both intermediate and core beliefs in a number of ways. You can look for the expression of a belief in an automatic thought; provide the conditional clause (“If . . . ) of an assumption and ask the patient to complete it; directly elicit a rule; use the downward arrow technique; recognize a common theme among automatic thoughts; ask patients what they think their belief is; or you can review the patient’s belief questionnaire. Deciding Whether to Modify a Belief Having identified a belief, you need to determine whether the interme -diate belief is central or more peripheral. Generally, to conduct therapy as efficiently as possible, you focus on the most important intermediate beliefs (Safran, Vallis, Segal, & Shaw, 1986). It is not worth the time or effort to work on dysfunctional beliefs that are tangential, or that patients believe only slightly. Th e r a p i s T: It sounds as if you believe if people don’t accept you, then you’re inferior. pa Ti e n T: I guess. Th e r a p i s T: How much do you believe that? pa Ti e n T: Not that much, maybe 20%. Th e r a p i s T: It doesn’t sound as if we have to work on that belief, then. How about if we get back to the problem we were discussing before? Having identified an important intermediate belief, you decide whether you will make the belief explicit to the patient and, if so, 210 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND whether you will merely identify the belief as one to be worked on in the future, or whether you will work on it at the present time. Ask yourself:“What is the belief? ”“How strongly does the patient believe it? ”“If strongly, how broadly and how strongly does it affect the patient’s life? ”“If broadly and strongly, should I work on it now? Is it likely the patient will be able to evaluate it with sufficient objectivity at this point? Do we have enough time in the session today to begin working on it? ”You will begin belief modification as soon as possible. When patients no longer endorse their beliefs or do not believe them as strongly, they will be able to interpret their experiences in a more realistic, func -tional way. But some beliefs are very deeply held, and it is advisable to teach patients to evaluate their more superficial cognitions (automatic thoughts) first, so they can learn that just because they think or believe something doesn’t necessarily mean it is true. Belief modification is relatively easy with some patients and much more difficult with others. Modifying intermediate beliefs is generally accomplished before modi -fying core beliefs, as the latter may be quite rigid. Educating Patients about Beliefs Having identified an important belief and checked that the patient believes it strongly, you may decide to educate the patient about the nature of beliefs in general, using a specific belief as an example. You might stress that there is a range of potential beliefs that the patient could adopt, and that beliefs are learned, not innate, and can be revised. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, we’ve identified some of your beliefs: “It’s terrible to do a mediocre job”; “I have to do everything great”; “If I do less than my best, I’m a failure. ” Where do you think you learned these ideas? pa Ti e n T: Growing up, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: Does everyone have these same beliefs? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks . ) No. Some people don’t seem to care. Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 211 Th e r a p i s T: Can you think of someone specifically who seems to have different beliefs? pa Ti e n T: Well, my cousin Emily, for one. Th e r a p i s T: What belief does she have? pa Ti e n T: I think she thinks it’s okay to be mediocre. She’s more inter -ested in having a good time. Th e r a p i s T: So she learned different beliefs? pa Ti e n T: I guess so. Th e r a p i s T: Well, the bad news is that you currently have a set of beliefs that aren’t bringing you much satisfaction, right? The good news is that since you learned this current set of beliefs, you can unlearn them and learn others—maybe not as extreme as Emily’s, but some -where in between hers and yours. How does that sound? Changing Rules and Attitudes into Assumption Form It is often easier for patients to see the distortion in and test an inter -mediate belief that is in the form of an assumption, rather than an intermediate belief that is in the form of a rule or an attitude. Having identified a rule or an attitude, you use the downward arrow technique to ascertain its meaning. Th e r a p i s T: So you believe pretty strongly that you should do things yourself [rule], and that it’s terrible to ask for help [attitude]. What does it mean to you to ask for help, for example with your school -work, instead of doing it yourself? pa Ti e n T: It means I’m incompetent. Th e r a p i s T: How much do you believe this idea right now, “If I ask for help, I’m incompetent? ”Logical evaluation of this conditional assumption through ques -tioning or other methods often creates greater cognitive dissonance than does evaluation of the rule or attitude. It is easier for Sally to rec -ognize the distortion and/or dysfunctionality in the assumption “If I ask for help, it means I’m incompetent” than in her rule “I shouldn’t ask for help. ”Examining Advantages and Disadvantages of Beliefs Often it is useful for patients to examine the advantages and disadvan -tages of continuing to hold a given belief. You then strive to minimize 212 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND or undermine the advantages and emphasize and reinforce the disad -vantages. (A similar process was previously described in the section on evaluating the utility of automatic thoughts on pages 174–175. )Th e r a p i s T: What are the advantages of believing if you don’t do your best, then you’re a failure? pa Ti e n T: Well, it might make me work harder. Th e r a p i s T: It’d be interesting to see whether you actually need such an extreme belief to keep you working hard. We’ll get back to that idea later. Any other advantages? pa Ti e n T: . . . No, not that I can think of. Th e r a p i s T: What are the disadvantages of believing you’re a failure if you don’t do your best? pa Ti e n T: Well, I feel miserable when I don’t do well on an exam . . . I get really nervous before presentations . . . I don’t have as much time to do other things I like because I’m so busy studying . . . Th e r a p i s T: And does it cut some enjoyment out of studying and learn -ing itself? pa Ti e n T: Oh, definitely. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, so on one hand, it may or may not actually be true that this belief is the only thing that makes you work hard. On the other hand, this belief about having to live up to your potential makes you feel miserable when you don’t do great, makes you more nervous than you have to be before presentations, cuts into your enjoyment of your work, and stops you from doing other things you like. Is that right? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Is this an idea, then, that you’d like to change? Formulating a New Belief In order to decide which strategies to use to modify a given belief, you clearly formulate to yourself a more adaptive belief. Ask yourself, “What belief would be more functional for the patient? ”For example, Figure 13. 5 lists Sally’s current beliefs and the new beliefs I have in mind. Although constructing a new belief is a collab -orative process, you nevertheless mentally formulate a range of more reasonable beliefs so you can appropriately choose strategies to change the old belief. Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 213 To summarize, before you try to modify a patient’s belief, you confirm that it is a central, strongly held belief, and you formulate in your own mind a more functional, less rigid belief that is thematically related to the dysfunctional one, but which you believe is more realis -tic and adaptive for the patient. You do not impose this belief on the patient, but rather you guide the patient in a collaborative manner, using Socratic questioning, to construct an alternative belief. You may also educate the patient about the nature of beliefs (e. g. , that they are ideas, not necessarily truths; that they have been learned and so can be unlearned; that they can be evaluated and modified) and/or help the patient assess the advantages and disadvantages of continuing to hold the belief. Sally’s old beliefs More functional beliefs 1. If I don’t do as well as others, I’m a failure. If I don’t do as well as others, I’m not a failure, just human. 2. If I ask for help, it’s a sign of weakness. If I ask for help when I need it, I’m showing good problem-solving abilities (which is a sign of strength). 3. If I fail at work/school, I’m a failure as a person. If I fail at work/school, it’s not a reflection of my whole self. ( my whole self includes how I am as a friend, daughter, sister, relative, citizen, and community member, and my qualities of kindness, sensitivity to others, helpfulness, etc. ) Also, failure is not a permanent condition. 4. I should be able to excel at everything I try. I shouldn’t be able to excel at something unless I am gifted in that area (and am willing and able to devote considerable time and effort toward it at the expense of other things). 5. I should always work hard and do my best. I should put in a reasonable amount of effort much of the time. 6. If I don’t live up to my potential, I have failed. If I do less than my best, I have succeeded perhaps 70%, 80%, or 90%; not 0%. 7. If I don’t work hard all the time, I’ll fail. If I don’t work hard all the time, I’ll probably do reasonably well and have a more balanced life. FIGURE 13. 5. Formulation of more functional beliefs. 214 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND m ODI f YING B El IEf SA number of strategies are useful in modifying both intermediate and core beliefs. (Additional techniques for modifying core beliefs are pre -sented in more detail in the next chapter. ) Some beliefs may change easily, but many take concerted effort over a period of time. You con -tinue to ask patients how much they currently believe a given belief (0–100%), at both an “intellectual” and at a “gut” or “emotional” level, to gauge whether further work is needed. It is usually neither possible nor necessarily desirable to reduce degrees of belief to 0%. Knowing when to stop working on a belief is therefore a judgment call. Generally, beliefs have been sufficiently attenuated when patients endorse them less than 30% and when they are likely to continue modifying their dysfunctional behavior despite still holding on to a remnant of the belief. It is advisable for patients to keep track, in their therapy notes, of the beliefs they have examined. A useful format includes the dysfunc -tional belief; the new, more functional belief; and the strength of each belief, expressed in a percentage, as in the following example:Old belief : “If I don’t achieve highly, I’m a failure. ” (50%)New belief : “I’m only an overall failure if I actually fail at almost everything. ” (80%)A typical homework assignment is to read and rerate daily how strongly the patient endorses both beliefs. Techniques to modify beliefs are listed below. Some are the same as those used to modify automatic thoughts. 1. Socratic questioning. 2. Behavioral experiments. 3. Cognitive continuum. 4. Intellectual–emotional role plays. 5. Using others as a reference point. 6. Acting “as if. ”7. Self-disclosure. Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 215 Socratic Questioning to Modify Beliefs As illustrated in the next transcript, I use the same kinds of questions to examine Sally’s belief that I used in evaluating her automatic thoughts. Even when I identify a general belief, I help her evaluate it in the con -text of specific situations. This specificity helps make the evaluation more concrete and meaningful, and less abstract and intellectual. Th e r a p i s T: [summarizing what they learned from the just-completed downward arrow technique] Okay, so you believe about 90% that if you ask for help, it means you’re incompetent. Is that right? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Could there be another way of viewing asking for help? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: Take therapy, for example. Are you incompetent because you came for help here? pa Ti e n T: A little, maybe. Th e r a p i s T: Hmmm. That’s interesting, because I usually view it in the opposite way. Is it possible it’s actually a sign of strength and compe -tence that you came to therapy? Because what would have happened if you hadn’t? pa Ti e n T: I might still be pulling the covers over my head. Th e r a p i s T: Are you suggesting that asking for appropriate help when you have an illness like depression is a more competent thing to do than remaining depressed? pa Ti e n T: Yeah . . . I guess so. Th e r a p i s T: Well, you tell me. Let’s say we have two depressed college students. One seeks treatment and the other doesn’t, but continues to have depressive symptoms. Which do you consider more compe -tent? pa Ti e n T: Well, the one who goes for help. Th e r a p i s T: Now how about another situation you’ve mentioned—your volunteer job. Again, we have two college students. This is their first tutoring experience. They’re not sure what to do because they’ve never done it before. One seeks help; the other doesn’t, but contin -ues to struggle. Who’s the more competent? pa Ti e n T: (hesitantly ) The one who goes for help? Th e r a p i s T: Are you sure? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks for a moment . ) Yeah. It’s not a sign of competence to just struggle if you could get help and do better. 216 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: How much do you believe that? pa Ti e n T: Pretty much—80%. Th e r a p i s T: And how do these two situations—therapy and help in tutoring—apply to you? pa Ti e n T: I guess they do. Th e r a p i s T: Let’s have you write something down about this . . . Let’s call the first idea “old belief”—now what did you say? pa Ti e n T: If I ask for help, I’m incompetent. Th e r a p i s T: How much do you believe it now? pa Ti e n T: Less. Maybe 40%. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, write “40%” next to it. pa Ti e n T: (Does so . )Th e r a p i s T: Now, write “new belief. ” How would you put that? pa Ti e n T: If I ask for help, I’m not incompetent? Th e r a p i s T: You don’t sound convinced. Would it be better if you phrased it, “If I ask for help when it’s reasonable, it’s a sign of com -petence”? pa Ti e n T: Yes. ( Writes that . )Th e r a p i s T: How much do you believe the new belief now? pa Ti e n T: A lot . . . (Reads and ponders the new belief . ) Maybe 70 to 80%. (Writes that down . )Th e r a p i s T: Okay, Sally, we’ll be coming back to these beliefs again. How about for homework this week you do two things? One is to read these beliefs every day and rate how much you believe them—actually write down the percentage next to the beliefs themselves. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: [providing a rationale] Writing down how much you believe them will make you really think about them. That’s why I didn’t say just read them. pa Ti e n T: Okay. ( Writes down the assignment . )Th e r a p i s T: Second, could you be on the lookout for other situations this week where you could reasonably ask for help? That is, let’s imagine that you believe the new belief 100%, that asking for rea -sonable help is a sign of competence. When during this coming week might you ask for help? Jot down those situations. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 217 In the previous segment, I use Socratic questioning in the context of specific situations to help Sally evaluate an intermediate belief. I judge that the standard questions of examining the evidence and evaluating outcomes will be less effective than leading Sally to develop an alterna -tive viewpoint. My questions are much more persuasive and less even -handed than when I help her evaluate more malleable cognitions at the automatic thought level. We devise a follow-up homework assignment that is designed to have Sally continue to reflect daily on both the dys -functional assumption and the new belief. Behavioral Experiments to Test Beliefs As with automatic thoughts, you can help patients devise behavioral tests to evaluate the validity of a belief. Behavioral experiments, when properly designed and carried out, can modify a patient’s beliefs more powerfully than verbal techniques in the office. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, Sally, we’ve identified another belief: “If I ask for help, others will belittle me, ” and you believe that 60%. Of course, I haven’t actually belittled you, have I? pa Ti e n T: No, of course not. But that’s your job, to help people. Th e r a p i s T: True, but it would be useful to find out if other people, in general, are more like me or not. How could you find out? pa Ti e n T: Ask other people for help, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, whom could you ask and for what kind of help? pa Ti e n T: Ummm. I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: Could you ask your roommate? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, actually I already do. And I guess I could ask my resi -dent adviser for help with something. Th e r a p i s T: Good. How about your academic adviser? pa Ti e n T: Uh-huh. I could also ask my brother. No. I won’t ask my room -mate or my brother. I know they wouldn’t belittle me. Th e r a p i s T: Oh, so you know already there are some exceptions? pa Ti e n T: Yes. But I guess I could go to my adviser or my teaching assis -tants. Th e r a p i s T: What could you ask for help with? pa Ti e n T: Well, the teaching assistants . . . I could ask questions about the papers I have due or about the readings. The resident adviser, I don’t know. My academic adviser . . . I would feel a little funny going to her. I don’t really even know what I want to major in. 218 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: That would be an interesting experiment—going for help in deciding a major to the person whose job it is to help students make those kinds of decisions. pa Ti e n T: True . . . Th e r a p i s T: So you might kill two birds with one stone—testing the belief that you’ll be belittled and getting some guidance for a real-life problem you have. pa Ti e n T: I guess I could. Th e r a p i s T: Good. So would you like to test the belief, “If I ask others for help, they’ll belittle me”? How would you like to do that this week? In the previous segment, I suggested a behavioral experiment to test a belief. Had I sensed that Sally felt hesitant, I would have asked her how likely she was to do the experiment and what practical prob-lems or thoughts might get in her way. I might also have her do covert rehearsal (see pages 303–305) to increase the likelihood of her follow-ing through. In addition, if I judged that there was the possibility of others’ belittling Sally, I might have discussed in advance what such belittling would mean to her and how she could cope if the belittling did occur. Also, I might have asked Sally for a description of belittling to ensure that she would not inaccurately perceive others’ behavior as belittling when they did not intend it to be. For an extensive description and discussion of behavioral experi-ments, see Bennett-Levy and colleagues (2004). Cognitive Continuum to Modify Beliefs This technique is useful to modify both automatic thoughts and beliefs that reflect polarized thinking (i. e. , when the patient sees something in all-or-nothing terms). Sally, for example, believed that if she was not a superior student, she was a failure. Building a cognitive continuum for the concept in question facilitates the patient’s recognition of the middle ground, as the following transcript illustrates:Th e r a p i s T: Okay, you believe pretty strongly that if you’re not a supe-rior student, you’re a failure. Let’s see what that looks like graphi-cally. ( Draws a number line . )Th e r a p i s T: Now, where does the superior student go? pa Ti e n T: Up here. I guess 90–100%. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. And, you’re a failure. Where are you? pa Ti e n T: At 0%, I guess. Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 219 Initial Graph of Success 0% 90% 100%Sally Superior student Th e r a p i s T: Now, is there anyone else who more realistically belongs at 0% than you? pa Ti e n T: Ummm . . . Maybe this guy, Jack, who’s in my economics class. I know he’s doing worse than I am. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. We’ll put Jack at 0%. But I wonder if there is anyone who’s doing even worse than Jack? pa Ti e n T: Probably. Th e r a p i s T: Is it conceivable that there is someone who is failing almost every test, every paper? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, now if we put that person at 0%, a real failure, where does that put Jack? Where does that put you? pa Ti e n T: Probably Jack’s at 30%. And I’m at 50%. Th e r a p i s T: Now, how about a person who is actually failing everything , and he isn’t even showing up at any classes or doing any of the read -ing or turning in any papers? pa Ti e n T: I guess he would be at 0%. Th e r a p i s T: Where does that put the student who is at least trying but not passing much? pa Ti e n T: I guess he would be at 10%. Th e r a p i s T: Where does that put you and Jack? pa Ti e n T: Jack goes to about 50%; I guess I’m at 75%. Revised Success Graph 0% 10% 50% 75% 90% 100%Student who does nothing Student who tries, but gets failing grades Jack Sally Superior students Th e r a p i s T: How about for homework if you see whether even 75% is accurate? Even if it is for this school, perhaps for schools and stu -dents in general, you would rank higher. In any case, how accurate is it to call someone a failure who is at the 75% mark? 220 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: Not very. Th e r a p i s T: Maybe the worst thing you can say is that he or she is 75% successful. pa Ti e n T: Yeah. ( Brightens visibly . )Th e r a p i s T: Okay, to get back to your original idea, how much do you believe now that if you are not a superior student, you’re a failure? pa Ti e n T: Not as much. Maybe 25%. Th e r a p i s T: Good! The cognitive continuum technique is often useful when the patient is displaying dichotomous thinking. As with most techniques, you may directly teach the patient how to employ the technique herself so she can use it when it is applicable:Th e r a p i s T: Sally, let’s review what we did here. We identified an all-or-nothing error in your thinking. Then we drew a number line to see whether there were really only two categories—success and fail -ure—or whether it’s more accurate to consider degrees of success. Can you think of anything else that you see in only two categories and that distresses you? Intellectual–Emotional Role Play This technique, also called point–counterpoint (Young, 1999), is usu -ally employed after you have tried other techniques such as those described in this chapter. It is particularly useful when patients say that intellectually they can see that a belief is dysfunctional, but that emotion -ally or in their gut it still “feels” true. You first provide a rationale for asking patients to play the “emotional” part of their mind that strongly endorses the dysfunctional belief, while you play the “intellectual” part. In the second segment you switch roles. Note in both segments you and patients both speak as the patient; that is, you both use the word “I. ”Th e r a p i s T: It sounds from what you’re saying that you still believe to some extent that you’re incompetent because you didn’t do as well in school last semester as you would have liked. pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: I’d like to get a better sense of what evidence you still have that supports your belief. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: Can we do a role play? I’ll play the “intellectual” part of Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 221 your mind that intellectually knows that just because you didn’t get all A’s doesn’t mean you are incompetent through and through. I’d like you to play the “emotional” part of your mind, that voice from your gut that still really believes you are incompetent. I want you to argue against me as hard as you can, so I can really see what’s maintaining the belief. Okay? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, you start. Say “I’m incompetent because I didn’t get all A’s. ”pa Ti e n T: I’m incompetent because I didn’t get all A’s. Th e r a p i s T: No, I’m not. I have a belief that I’m incompetent, but I am reasonably competent most of the time. pa Ti e n T: No, I’m not. If I were truly competent, I would have gotten all A’s last semester. Th e r a p i s T: That’s not true. Competence doesn’t equal total academic perfection. If that were true, only 1% of the students in the world would be competent, and everyone else would be incompetent. pa Ti e n T: Well, I got a C in chemistry. That proves I’m incompetent. Th e r a p i s T: That’s not right, either. If I had flunked the course perhaps it might be reasonable to say I wasn’t competent in chemistry, but it doesn’t make me incompetent in everything . Besides, maybe I really am competent in chemistry, but I flunked for other reasons; for example, I was depressed and couldn’t concentrate on my study -ing. pa Ti e n T: But a truly competent person wouldn’t become depressed in the first place. Th e r a p i s T: Actually, even truly competent people get depressed. There isn’t a connection there. And when truly competent people get depressed, their concentration and motivation definitely suffer and they don’t perform as well as usual. But that doesn’t mean they are incompetent through and through. pa Ti e n T: I guess that’s true. They’re just depressed. Th e r a p i s T: You’re right, but you’re out of role. Any more evidence that you’re completely incompetent? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks for a moment . ) No, I guess not. Th e r a p i s T: Well, how about if we trade roles now, and this time you be the “intellectual” part who disputes my “emotional” part? And I’ll use your same arguments. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: I’ll start. “I’m incompetent because I don’t get all A’s. ” 222 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Switching roles provides patients with an opportunity to speak with the intellectual voice that you have just modeled. You use the same emo -tional reasoning and the same words that the patients used. Using their own words and not introducing new material help patients to respond more precisely to their specific concerns. If patients are unable to formulate a response while in the intel -lectual role, you can either switch roles temporarily or come out of role to discuss the stuck point. As with any belief modification technique, you will evaluate both its effectiveness and the degree to which patients need further work on the belief. You do so by asking patients to rate how much they believe the belief after the intervention. Many patients find the intellectual–emotional role play useful. A few, however, feel uncomfortable doing it. As with any intervention, the decision to use it should be collaborative. Because it is a slightly argu -mentative technique, take special note of patients’ nonverbal reactions during the role play. Also take care to ensure that patients do not feel criticized or denigrated by the elevation of the intellectual part of their mind over the emotional part. Using Other People as a Reference Point in Belief Modification When patients consider other people’s beliefs, they often obtain psycho -logical distance from their own dysfunctional beliefs. They begin to see an inconsistency between what they believe is true or right for them -selves and what they more objectively believe is true about other people. Following are four examples of using other people as a reference point to gain distance. Example 1 Th e r a p i s T: Sally, you mentioned last week that you think your cousin Emily has a different belief about having to do everything great. pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: Could you put what you think her belief is into words? pa Ti e n T: She thinks she doesn’t have to do great. She’s an okay person, no matter what. Th e r a p i s T: Do you believe she’s right? That she doesn’t have to do great to be an okay person? pa Ti e n T: Oh, yes. Th e r a p i s T: Do you see her as incompetent, through and through? Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 223 pa Ti e n T: Oh, no. She might not get good grades, but she’s competent in lots of other ways. Th e r a p i s T: I wonder if Emily’s belief could apply to you: “If I don’t do great, I’m still an okay, competent person. ”pa Ti e n T: Hmmm. Th e r a p i s T: Is there something different about Emily that makes her okay and competent no matter how well or poorly she does, but not you? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks for a moment . ) No. I don’t think so. I guess I hadn’t really thought of it that way. Th e r a p i s T: How much do you believe right now, “If I don’t do great, I’m incompetent”? pa Ti e n T: Less, maybe 60%. Th e r a p i s T: And how much do you believe this new belief, “If I don’t do great, I’m still an okay, competent person”? pa Ti e n T: More than before. Maybe 70%. Th e r a p i s T: Good. How about if we have you write down the new belief and start making a list of the evidence that supports this new belief. At this point, you might introduce the Core Belief Worksheet, described in Chapter 14, which can be used for both core beliefs and intermediate beliefs. Example 2 Another way to help patients modify an intermediate or core belief is to have them identify someone else who plainly seems to have the same dysfunctional belief. Sometimes patients can see the distortion in some -one else’s thinking and apply this insight to themselves. This technique is analogous to the Thought Record question: “If [friend’s name] was in this situation and had this thought, what would I tell [him/her]? ”Th e r a p i s T: Is there someone else you know who has your same belief, “If I don’t work hard, I’ll fail”? pa Ti e n T: I’m sure my friend Rebecca, from high school, believes that. She’s always studying, night and day. Th e r a p i s T: How accurate do you think that belief is for her? pa Ti e n T: Oh, not at all. She’s very bright. She probably couldn’t fail if she tried. 224 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Is it possible that she might consider anything less than an A a failure, too? pa Ti e n T: Yes, I know she does. Th e r a p i s T: And do you agree with her, that if she gets a B, then she’s failed? pa Ti e n T: No, of course not. Th e r a p i s T: How would you view it? pa Ti e n T: She got a B. An okay grade, not the best, but not a failure . Th e r a p i s T: What belief would you like her to have? pa Ti e n T: It’s good to work hard and try for A’s, but it’s not the end of the world if you don’t get them. And it doesn’t mean you’ve failed. Th e r a p i s T: How does all this apply to you? pa Ti e n T: Hmmm. I guess it’s the same. Th e r a p i s T: Could you spell out what’s the same? pa Ti e n T: That if I don’t get all A’s, I haven’t failed. I still think I should work hard, though. Th e r a p i s T: Sure. It’s reasonable to want to work hard and do well. The unreasonable part is to believe you’ve failed if you haven’t done perfectly. Do you agree with that? Example 3 You could also do a role play with patients in which you instruct them to convince another person that the belief they both share is invalid for the other person. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, you say you think your roommate also believes that she shouldn’t go to a professor for help because he might think she’s unprepared or not smart enough? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Do you agree with her? pa Ti e n T: No. She’s probably wrong. But even if he is critical, it doesn’t mean he’s right. Th e r a p i s T: Could we try to role-play this? I’ll be your roommate; you give me advice. Don’t let me get away with any distorted thinking. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: I’ll start. Sally, I don’t understand this stuff. What should I do? Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 225 pa Ti e n T: Go to the professor. Th e r a p i s T: Oh, I couldn’t do that. He’ll think I’m dumb. He’ll think I’m wasting his time. pa Ti e n T: Hey, it’s his job to help students. Th e r a p i s T: But he probably doesn’t like students bothering him. pa Ti e n T: Tough, that’s what he’s getting paid for. Anyway, good profes -sors like to help students. If he’s impatient, that says something about him, not about you. Th e r a p i s T: But even if he doesn’t mind helping, he’ll find out how confused I am. pa Ti e n T: That’s okay. He won’t expect you to know everything. That’s why you’re coming to him. Th e r a p i s T: What if he thinks I’m dumb? pa Ti e n T: First of all, you wouldn’t be here if you were dumb. Second, if he does expect you to know everything, he’s just wrong. If you did know everything, you wouldn’t be taking his course. Th e r a p i s T: I still think I shouldn’t go. pa Ti e n T: No, you should. Don’t let his snobby attitude make you feel like you’re imposing or you’re dumb. You’re not. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. I’m convinced. Out of role, how does what you told your roommate apply to you? Example 4 Finally, many patients can get distance from a belief by using their own children (or children they know) as a reference point, or by imagining that they have children. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, so you believe 80% that if you don’t do as well as everyone else, then you’ve failed? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: I wonder, can you imagine that you have a daughter? She’s 10 years old and in fifth grade, and she comes home one day very, very upset because her friends got A’s on a test and she got a C. Would you want her to believe that she’s a failure? pa Ti e n T: No, of course not. Th e r a p i s T: Why not? . . . What would you like her to believe? ( Sally responds . ) Now how does what you’ve just said apply to you? 226 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Acting “As If”Changes in belief often lead to corresponding changes in behavior. And changes in behavior, in turn, often lead to corresponding changes in belief. If a belief is fairly weak, the patient may be able to change a target behavior easily and quickly, without much cognitive intervention. Many beliefs do require some modification before the patient is willing to change behaviorally. However, frequently only some belief modifica -tion, not complete belief change, is needed. And once patients begin to change their behavior, the belief itself becomes somewhat more attenu -ated (which makes it easier to continue the new behavior, which further attenuates the belief, and so on, in a positive upward spiral). Th e r a p i s T: Okay, Sally, how much do you believe now that it’s a sign of weakness to ask for help? pa Ti e n T: Not as much. Maybe 50%. Th e r a p i s T: That’s a good drop. Would it be to your benefit to act as if you don’t believe it at all? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure what you mean. Th e r a p i s T: If you didn’t believe it was a sign of weakness, in fact, if you believed it was good to ask for help, what might you do this week? pa Ti e n T: Well, we’ve been talking about my going to see the teaching assistant. I guess if I really believed it was good to ask for help, I would go. Th e r a p i s T: Anything else? pa Ti e n T: I might try to find a tutor for Economics . . . I might ask to bor -row notes from the guy down the hall . . . Th e r a p i s T: Hey, that’s good. And what positive things could happen if you did some of these things? pa Ti e n T: (Laughs . ) I could get the help that I need. Th e r a p i s T: Do you think you’re ready this week to act as if you believe it’s a good thing to ask for help? pa Ti e n T: Maybe. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, in a minute, we’ll find out what thoughts might get in the way, but first, how about if you jot down those ideas you had. And do you want to write down this technique to get you going? Act as if you believe the new belief, even if you don’t totally. This acting “as if” technique is equally applicable to core beliefs as are the preceding intermediate belief modification techniques. Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 227 Using Self-Disclosure to Modify Beliefs Using appropriate and judicious self-disclosure can help some patients view their problems or beliefs in a different way. The self-disclosure, of course, should be genuine and relevant:Th e r a p i s T: You know, Sally, when I was in college, I had some trouble going to professors for help because I thought I’d be showing my ignorance too. And to tell you the truth, the few times I did end up doing it anyway, I had mixed results. Sometimes the professors were really nice and helpful. But a couple of times, they were pretty brusque, just told me to reread a chapter or something. The point is, just because I didn’t understand something didn’t mean I was incompetent. And the professors who were brusque—well, I think that said a lot more about them than about me. ( pause ) What do you think? In summary, you help patients to identify intermediate beliefs by recognizing when a belief has been expressed as an automatic thought, by providing part of an assumption, by directly eliciting a rule or an atti -tude, by using the downward arrow technique, by looking for common themes among the patient’s automatic thoughts, and/or by reviewing a belief questionnaire completed by the patient. You next determine how important the belief is by ascertaining how strongly the patient believes it, and how broadly and strongly it affects her functioning. Then you decide whether to begin the task of modifying it in the current session or wait for future sessions. When beginning belief modification work, you educate the patient about the nature of beliefs, change rules and atti -tudes into assumption form , and explore the advantages and disadvantages of a given belief. You mentally formulate a new, more functional belief and guide the patient toward its adoption through many belief modification techniques , including Socratic questioning, behavioral experiments, cognitive continua, intellectual–emotional role plays, using others as a reference point, acting “as if, ” and self-disclosure. Some of these tech -niques are more persuasive than standard Socratic questioning of auto -matic thoughts, because the beliefs are much more rigidly held. These same techniques can also be used to modify core beliefs. 228 Chapter 14 IDENTIf YING AND m ODIf YING CORE BEl IEf SCore beliefs, as described in Chapter 3, are one’s most central ideas about the self. Some authors refer to these beliefs as schemas. Beck (1964) differentiates the two by suggesting that schemas are cogni-tive structures within the mind, the specifi c content of which are core beliefs. Furthermore, he theorizes that negative core beliefs essentially fall into two broad categories: those associated with helplessness and those associated with unlovability (Beck, 1999). A third category, asso-ciated with worthlessness, has also been described (J. S. Beck, 2005). Some patients have core beliefs that fall in one category; others have core beliefs in two or all three categories. People develop these beliefs from an early age, as children, with their genetic predisposition toward certain personality traits, interact with signifi cant others, and encounter a series of situations. For much of their lives, most people maintain relatively positive and realistic core beliefs (e. g. , “I am substantially in control”; “I can do most things com-petently”; “I am a functional human being”; “I am likable”; “I am worth-while”). Negative core beliefs may surface only during times of psycho-logical distress. (Some patients with personality disorders, however, may have almost continuously activated negative core beliefs. ) Often, unlike automatic thoughts, core beliefs that patients “know” to be true about themselves are not fully articulated until you peel back the layers by continuing to ask for the meaning of their thoughts. Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 229 It is important to note that patients may also have negative core beliefs about other people and their worlds: “Other people are untrust -worthy”; “Other people will hurt me”; “The world is a rotten place”; “The world is dangerous. ” Fixed, overgeneralized ideas such as these often need to be evaluated and modified, in addition to core beliefs about the self. Before Sally became depressed, she recognized when she was act -ing competently and interpreted signs of possible incompetence as situ -ation specific; for example, when she got a lower grade than expected on a paper in high school, she took it as an instance of inadequacy, but she did not interpret this situation as meaning she was an overall incompetent person. As Sally was becoming depressed, her positive schema became deac -tivated and her negative schema containing the cognition “I am incom -petent” became almost fully activated. As illustrated on page 34, Sally began to overemphasize and overgeneralize negative data, contained in negative rectangles, continually reinforcing her belief that she was incompetent. At the same time, Sally was failing to recognize a signifi -cant amount of positive data related to her schema (such as resuming her usual activities even though the depression made it very difficult to do so); these positive triangles “bounced off” the schema and did not get incorporated. Sally also discounted much positive information through her “Yes, but . . . ” interpretations of her experiences (“Yes, I did well on the quiz, but it was easy. ”; “Yes, I helped the kid I was tutoring, but I got lucky because I really didn’t know what I was doing. ”). These positive triangles were, in essence, changed into negative rectangles. Sally was not volitionally processing information in this dysfunc -tional way. This kind of information processing is automatic and a symptom of depression. I recognized that it would be important to work directly on modifying her negative core belief, not only to alleviate her current depression, but also to prevent or reduce the severity of future episodes. For example, one day when Sally was depressed, she received a B– on an exam. She immediately understood this data as signifying that she was an incompetent person. When she received an A on a paper the next day, her mind automatically discounted this positive evidence that was contrary to her negative core belief. She believed the good grade was not an indication of competence; in fact, she believed that she was incompetent and that she had merely “fooled” the professor. She also failed to recognize other positive data; for example, that she got to every class on time. (Note that had she gotten to class late or skipped class, she would have interpreted those experiences in a negative light, as confirming her negative core belief. ) 230 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND You will begin to work directly on belief modification as early in treatment as possible. Once patients change their beliefs, they are less likely to process data in a maladaptive way. In specific situations, they have different (more adaptive and realistic) automatic thoughts and improved reactions. You may not succeed with early belief modification, though, if patients:Have core beliefs that are quite rigid and overgeneralized. • Do not yet believe that cognitions are ideas and not • necessarily truths. Experience very high levels of affect when beliefs are • elicited or questioned. Do not have a strong enough alliance with you (they • may not trust you sufficiently; they may not perceive you as understanding who they really are; they may feel invalidated by the process of belief evaluation). In these cases, you will teach patients the tools of identifying, evaluat -ing, and adaptively responding to automatic thoughts and intermediate beliefs before using the same tools for core beliefs. You may unwittingly try to evaluate a core belief early in treatment because it has been expressed as an automatic thought. Such evalua -tion may have little effect. In another case, you may intentionally test the modifiability of a core belief even before you have done much work at the automatic thought and intermediate belief level. The degree of difficulty in identifying and modifying core beliefs varies from patient to patient. In general, patients who are in significant emotional distress are more easily able than others to express their core beliefs (because the beliefs are activated in session). And, in general, it is far easier to modify the negative core beliefs of Axis I patients whose counterbalancing positive core beliefs have been activated throughout much of their lives. Negative core beliefs of patients with personality disorders are usually much more difficult to modify (J. S. Beck, 2005; Beck et al. , 2004; Young, 1999) because they typically have fewer posi -tive core beliefs, their positive core beliefs are weaker, and they have developed a multitude of strongly held negative core beliefs that inter -connect and support each other like a network. In identifying and modifying core beliefs, you do the following during the course of treatment (each step is described later in this chapter): Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 2311. mentally hypothesize from which category of core belief (“helplessness” or “unlovability” or “worthlessness”) specific automatic thoughts appear to have arisen (see f igure 14. 1). 2. Specify the core belief (to yourself) using the same techniques you use to identify patients’ intermediate beliefs. 3. Present your hypothesis about the core belief to patients, asking for confirmation or disconfirmation; refine your hypothesis about the core belief as patients provide additional data about current and childhood situations and their reactions to them. 4. Educate patients about core beliefs in general and about their specific core beliefs; guide patients in monitoring the operation of the core belief in the present. 5. Help patients specify and strengthen a new, more adaptive core belief. 6. Begin to evaluate and modify the negative core belief with patients; examine the childhood origin of the core belief (if applicable), its maintenance through the years, and its contribution to patients’ present difficulties; continue to monitor the activation of the core belief in the present; use both “intellectual” and “emotional” or experiential methods to decrease the strength of the old core belief and to increase the strength of the new core belief. CATEGORI z ING C ORE B El IEf SAs mentioned previously, patients’ core beliefs may be categorized in the helplessness realm, the unlovability realm, and/or the worthlessness realm. Whenever patients present data (problems, automatic thoughts, emotions, behavior, history), you “listen” for the category of core belief that seems to have been activated. For example, when Sally expresses thoughts about her work being too hard, about her inability to concen -trate, and about her fears of failing, I hypothesize that a core belief in the helpless category was operating. Sally occasionally mentions auto -matic thoughts that her friends might not want to spend time with her because she is depressed. When I do the downward arrow technique, asking what that means about her, she shrugs and says, with little emo -tion: “I just won’t have anyone to hang out with. ” Sally does not seem to have a significant core belief of unlovability. 232 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Another patient consistently expresses thoughts of others not car -ing about him and fears that he is too different from others to sustain a relationship. This patient has a core belief in the category of unlov -ability. A third patient is frustrated by her inability to get others to listen to her. Although her distress occurs only in interpersonal situations, she does not believe that she is unlovable. Her core belief of helpless -ness is what gets activated. Finally, a fourth patient feels like a worth -less human being, not because he cannot achieve (a helpless belief), and not related to his relationships (which might possibly be an unlov -able belief). He believes that morally, he is a bad person (a worthless belief). The top of Figure 14. 1 lists typical core beliefs in the helpless cat -egory. Themes include being ineffective:In getting things done (“I’m inadequate”; “I’m incompetent”; “I • can’t do anything right”). In protecting oneself (“I’m vulnerable, weak, powerless, • trapped”). In achievement (“I’m a failure, I don’t measure up, I’m a • loser”). The middle of Figure 14. 1 lists typical core beliefs in the unlovable cat -egory. Themes include being unlikable, undesirable, unappealing, or defective (not in achievement or morality, but being defective in char -acter so as to preclude gaining the sustained love and caring of others). The bottom of Figure 14. 1 lists worthless core beliefs. When patients have beliefs in this category, they are not unduly concerned with their efffectiveness or lovability. They just believe that they are bad, unwor -thy, or even dangerous to other people. Sometimes it is clear in which category a given core belief belongs, especially when patients actually use words such as “I am helpless, ” or “I am unlovable. ” At other times, you may not know initially which cat -egory of core belief has been activated. For example, depressed patients may say, “I’m not good enough. ” You need to ascertain the meaning of the cognition to determine whether they believe they are not good enough to achieve or to gain respect (helpless category), or if they are not good enough for others to love them (unlovable category). To summarize, you begin mentally to formulate a hypothesis about patients’ core beliefs whenever they provide data in the form of their automatic thoughts (and associated meanings) and reactions (emo -tions and behaviors). You first make a gross distinction (to yourself) among cognitions that seem to fall in the helpless, unlovable, or worth -less categories. Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 233 IDENTI f YING C ORE B El IEf SYou use the same techniques to identify patients’ specific core beliefs that you used when identifying their intermediate beliefs (see Chapter 13). In addition to the downward arrow technique, you look for central themes in patients’ automatic thoughts , watch for core beliefs expressed as auto -matic thoughts , and directly elicit the core belief. You will often identify a core belief early in therapy to conceptual -ize patients and plan treatment. You may gather data about and even try to help patients evaluate their core beliefs early on. In some cases, such early evaluation is ineffective but helps you test the strength, breadth, and modifiability of the core belief. Helpless core beliefs“I am incompetent. ”“I am ineffective. ”“I can’t do anything right. ”“I am helpless. ”“I am powerless. ”“I am weak. ”“I am vulnerable. ”“I am a victim. ”“I am needy. ”“I am trapped. ”“I am out of control. ”“I am a failure. ”“I am defective” [i. e. , I do not measure up to others]. “I am not good enough” [in terms of achievement]. “I am a loser. ”Unlovable core beliefs“I am unlovable. ”“I am unlikeable. ”“I am undesirable. ”“I am unattractive. ”“I am unwanted. ”“I am uncared for. ”“I am different. ”“I am bad [so others will not love me]. ”“I am defective [so others will not love me]. ”“I am not good enough [to be loved by others]. ”“I am bound to be rejected. ”“I am bound to be abandoned. ”“I am bound to be alone. ”Worthless core beliefs“I am worthless. ”“I am unacceptable. ”“I am bad. ”“I am a waste. ”“I am immoral. ”“I am dangerous. ”“I am toxic. ”“I am evil. ”“I don’t deserve to live. ”FIGURE 14. 1. Categories of core beliefs. Adapted from Cognitive therapy for chal -lenging problems: What to do when the basics don’t work . Copyright 2005 by Judith S. Beck. New York: Guilford Press. 234 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: What went through your mind when you couldn’t finish the statistics assignment? pa Ti e n T: I can’t do anything right. I’ll never be able to make it here. Th e r a p i s T: [downward arrow technique] And if that’s true, that you can’t do anything right and you can’t make it here, what does that mean? pa Ti e n T: [core belief] I’m hopeless. I’m so incompetent. Th e r a p i s T: How much do you believe you’re incompetent? pa Ti e n T: Oh, 100%. Th e r a p i s T: And how incompetent are you: a little, a lot? pa Ti e n T: Completely. I’m completely incompetent. Th e r a p i s T: In every way? pa Ti e n T: Just about. Th e r a p i s T: Any evidence that you’re not incompetent? pa Ti e n T: No . . . No, I don’t think so. Th e r a p i s T: Did you say you’re doing okay in your other courses? pa Ti e n T: Yes, but not as well as I should be. Th e r a p i s T: Does the fact that you’re doing okay in them contradict this idea that you’re incompetent? pa Ti e n T: No, if I were really competent, I’d be doing much better. Th e r a p i s T: How about other areas of your life—managing your apart -ment, managing your finances, taking care of yourself . . . ? pa Ti e n T: I’m doing pretty badly at them, too. Th e r a p i s T: So this idea that you’re incompetent extends to other things, too? pa Ti e n T: Just about everything. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, I can see how strongly you believe this idea. Can we go back to the situation in which you couldn’t finish the statistics assignment and you had the thoughts: “I can’t do anything right. I’ll never be able to make it here. ”In this example, I use the downward arrow technique to identify an idea I conceptualize as a core belief. I gently test its strength, breadth, and modifiability, and decide not to pursue further evaluation at this time. However, I label it as an “idea” (implying it is not necessarily a truth) and mark it as a future topic. Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 235 PRESENTING C ORE B El IEf SWhen you believe that you have collected sufficient data to hypothesize about the core belief, and when you believe patients will be sufficiently receptive, you tentatively pose your conceptualization to them, as I did below. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, we’ve talked about a number of different problems in the past few weeks—your schoolwork, decisions about how to spend the summer, your volunteer job. Whenever we examine your thoughts, and ask you what they mean about you, you consistently say they mean that you’re incompetent . . . Is that right? pa Ti e n T: Yes. I still think I’m incompetent. Or you might review with patients a number of related automatic thoughts they had in a variety of situations and then ask them to draw a conclusion as to an underlying pattern (“Sally, do you see a common theme in these automatic thoughts? ”). With certain patients you can use a hand-drawn diagram, a simpli -fied version of the Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram (page 200), early in treatment. Either with or without the diagram, you might briefly explore childhood precursors. Th e r a p i s T: Do you remember feeling incompetent like this at other times in your life, too? As a child? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, sometimes. I remember never being able to do things my brother could. Th e r a p i s T: Can you give me some examples? You will use historical data later, when you hypothesize to patients how they came to believe a core belief, and explain how the core belief could be untrue or mostly untrue even though they currently believe it so strongly. EDUCATING P ATIENTS ABOUT C ORE B El IEf S AND m ONITORING T HEIR O PERATIONIt is important for patients to understand the following about a core belief: 236 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND That it is an idea, not necessarily a truth. • That they can believe it quite strongly, even “feel” it to be • true, and yet it might be mostly or entirely untrue. That, as an idea, it can be tested. • That it may be rooted in childhood events, and may or • may not have been true at the time they first came to believe it. That it continues to be maintained through the operation • of their schemas, in which they readily recognize data that support the core belief while ignoring or discounting data to the contrary. That you and they, working together, can use a variety of • strategies over time to change this idea so that they can view themselves in a more realistic way. In the transcript that follows, I educate Sally about her core belief. (She had previously confirmed the conceptualization I had pre -sented. )Th e r a p i s T: Sally, does this [automatic thought that she will not be able to write her economics paper] sound familiar? Do you think your idea that you’re incompetent could be getting in the way? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. I do feel incompetent. Th e r a p i s T: Well, Sally, one of two things has been going on. The prob -lem is either you really are incompetent, and we’ll have to do some work together to make you more competent . . . or the problem is that you believe you are incompetent; and sometimes, you believe it so strongly that you actually act in an incompetent way, like not going to the library to start researching your paper. ( pause ) What do you think? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. Th e r a p i s T: Why don’t we write these two possibilities on paper? This is what I’d like to start doing in therapy, if it is okay with you, seeing which possibility seems more true—that you really are incompe -tent, or that you believe you’re incompetent. Later I explain core beliefs to Sally, in small parts, making sure she understands as I proceed. Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 237 Th e r a p i s T: This idea, “I’m incompetent, ” is what we call a core belief. Let me tell you a little bit about core beliefs so you’ll understand why they’re more difficult to evaluate and respond to. Okay? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: First of all, a core belief is an idea that you may not believe very strongly when you’re not depressed. On the other hand, we’d expect you to believe it almost completely when you are depressed, even if there’s evidence to the contrary. ( pause ) Follow me so far? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: When you get depressed, this idea becomes activated. When it’s activated, you’ll easily notice any evidence that seems to support it, and you’ll tend to ignore any evidence that contradicts it. It’s as if there is a screen around your head. Anything that fits in with the idea that you are incompetent sails straight through the screen and into your head. Any information that contradicts the idea won’t fit through the screen, and so either you don’t notice it, or you change it in some way so it will fit through the screen. Do you think you might be screening information like this? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: Well, let’s see. Looking back at the past few weeks, what evidence is there that you might be competent? pa Ti e n T: Ummm . . . I got an A on my statistics exam. Th e r a p i s T: Good! And did that evidence go right through the screen? Did you tell yourself, “I got an A. That means I’m smart or compe -tent or a good student, ” or anything like that? pa Ti e n T: No. I said, “Well, the exam was easy. I learned some of that stuff last year. ”Th e r a p i s T: Oh, so it looks like the screen was operating. Do you see how you discounted information that contradicted your core belief, “I am incompetent”? pa Ti e n T: Hmmm. Th e r a p i s T: Can you think of any other examples from this week? Situ -ations where a reasonable person might think something you did showed you were competent, even if you didn’t? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks for a moment . ) Well, I helped my roommate figure out how to solve a problem with her father. But that doesn’t count; any -one could have done what I did. Th e r a p i s T: Good example. Again, it sounds as if you didn’t recognize information that doesn’t fit in with your idea: “I’m incompetent. ” 238 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND I’m going to let you think about how true the idea is that anyone could have done what you did. Maybe this is another instance of not giving yourself credit, when another person might have thought it was evidence that you are not incompetent. pa Ti e n T: Well, my roommate did think I helped her a lot. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, just to summarize: “I’m incompetent” seems to be a core belief that goes back a long time with you, and which you believe much more strongly when you’re depressed. Can you sum -marize how it seems to work? pa Ti e n T: Well, you’re saying that when I’m depressed, I screen in infor -mation that agrees with it and I screen out information that doesn’t agree with it. Th e r a p i s T: Right. How about for homework this week if you try to notice each day how the screen is operating—jot down information that seems to support the idea that you’re incompetent. And here’s the harder part. Really hunt for and jot down any information that another person might think contradicts it. Okay? In the next session, I explain why Sally believes her core belief so strongly and how it could still be untrue. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, you did a good job this week noticing how you tend to let in only the negative information that seems to support your idea that you’re incompetent. As we predicted, it was much harder to recognize positive information that contradicts your idea. pa Ti e n T: Yeah. I didn’t do it very well. Th e r a p i s T: Are you feeling incompetent now? pa Ti e n T: (Laughs . ) Yes. I guess so. Th e r a p i s T: Is the screen operating right now? Did you put more emphasis on the part of the homework you didn’t do as well, and forget about the part you did do well? pa Ti e n T: I guess I did. Th e r a p i s T: What do you think is the effect of having a screen like this? pa Ti e n T: Makes me not notice the good things. Th e r a p i s T: Right. And, day after day, what happens to this idea, “I’m incompetent”? pa Ti e n T: Gets stronger, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: Right. To the point where it “feels” true, even if it’s not. pa Ti e n T: Hmmm. Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 239 Th e r a p i s T: Do you see now how the idea that you’re incompetent could be false, even though it feels so true? pa Ti e n T: Well, I can kind of see it intellectually, but I still do feel incom -petent. Th e r a p i s T: That’s pretty common. In the next few weeks, we’ll keep evaluating this idea. And then we’ll work together on helping the more reasonable, intellectual part of your mind talk to the more emotional side. Okay? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Alternatively, I could have drawn the schema diagram from page 34 and elicited the same examples of positive and negative data, and asked Sally whether she thought the diagram accurately illustrated how she was processing information. I would then ask her, “Sally, if it’s true that you’ve been overemphasizing the negative data and ignoring or discounting the positive data, can you see how your idea that you’re incompetent could grow stronger with each passing hour and each passing day and week and month—but it might not be true, or not com -pletely true? ”Bibliotherapy can reinforce important core belief work. Prisoners of Belief (Mc Kay & Fanning, 1991) and Reinventing Your Life (Young & Klosko, 1994) are helpful in this phase of treatment. DEVEl OPING A N EW C ORE B El IEf Many depressed patients had a different core belief, a more positive, reality-based, and functional idea about themselves, before the onset of their Axis I disorder. They may easily identify this belief. Th e r a p i s T: Before you got depressed, say a year ago, how did you see yourself? Did you think you were unlikable? pa Ti e n T: No; I mean, not everyone liked me, but I basically thought I was a good person. People liked me. Th e r a p i s T: So was your belief “I’m likable”? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, it was. When patients cannot express their former idea, you mentally devise a new, more realistic, and functional belief and guide patients toward it. A relatively positive belief is generally easier for patients to adopt than a belief that is at an extreme. For example: 240 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Old core belief New core belief“I’m (completely) unlovable. ” “I’m generally a likable person”“I’m bad. ” “I’m okay. ”“I’m powerless. ” “I have control over many things. ”“I’m defective. ” “I’m normal, with both strengths and weaknesses. ”Th e r a p i s T: Sally, we’ve been talking about this core belief, “I’m incom -petent. ” What do you intellectually think a more accurate belief might be? pa Ti e n T: I am competent? Th e r a p i s T: That’s good. Or we could work on a new belief that might be easier for you to adopt, say, “I’m competent in most ways, but I’m only human, too. ” Which sounds better? pa Ti e n T: The second. Having identified a negative core belief and devised a positive belief, you will simultaneously work on weakening the first and strengthening the latter. STRENGTHENING N EW C ORE B El IEf SYou will primarily strengthen new core beliefs in two ways. One, from the beginning of treatment, as described on pages 26–27, you deliber -ately elicit positive data from patients through questioning, and you also point out positive data to them—especially when the data contra -dict the old, negative core belief but support a new, more reality-based belief. Two, when specifically working on strengthening their new core beliefs, you ask patients to examine their experiences in a new way that facilitates their ability to recognize positive data themselves. I accomplished the tasks of eliciting and pointing out positive data in several ways with Sally. For example:At the evaluation, I asked Sally what her strengths were. • Later, whenever applicable, I asked her whether certain data indi - • cated other strengths. (“So you did all these things: you made a list of all your assignments for this week and figured out when you would do them and what resources you would need. Is being organized a strength of yours? ”)During the first part of the session, I asked Sally about her posi - • tive experiences (“What positive things happened since I saw Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 241 you last? ”). Finishing a paper, doing reasonably well on an exam, being assertive with her roommate, figuring out which classes to sign up for, starting a self-defense class, to name a few examples, all provided data that I emphasized at the time and later that supported her new core belief. I suggested that Sally keep a credit list (page 275). • I continually asked Sally for (positive) evidence that her cogni - • tions were not true, or not completely true. I asked for her attribution when she displayed positive behaviors • (“What does it say about you that you were the one to initiate the recycling project? ”). I provided her with feedback about her accomplishments and • positive qualities (“It sounds like you did a great job organizing the get-together for the dorm”). The second strategy involves helping patients adopt a different view of their experiences. They do so by asking themselves what they are doing or what is happening that could lend support to the new core belief. (“Sally, can you keep track this coming week of anything that shows that you are competent? ”) If patients have difficulty with this assignment, you can modify it. (“Sally, could you pretend I’m following you around this week? Notice the times when you think I would say, ‘That shows you’re competent, ’ or could you notice what your room -mate does that shows you she’s competent—and then see whether you’re doing the same thing? ”)Most patients need a visual or audio cue to remind themselves to look for positive data throughout the day, for example, they can wear a rub -ber band around their wrist, post sticky notes, have pop-up reminders on their computers or smartphones, or set the alarm on their cell phone to ring periodically. Encourage them to record the data in some way, instead of just making mental notes that they are likely to forget. A Core Belief Worksheet (Figure 14. 3) can help them organize their note taking. Finally, it is important to track with patients how strongly they believe their new core belief over time, both at an intellectual level and an emotional level. You will elicit instances in which their degree of belief was relatively higher and reinforce their interpretation, and you will help them reframe the meaning of experiences in which their belief was relatively lower. m ODI f YING N EGATIVE C ORE B El IEf STo help patients change their negative core beliefs, you will use many techniques described in the previous chapter, as well as others that are 242 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND described below (see Figure 14. 2). Core beliefs usually change at the intellectual level first, especially when you have been employing intel -lectual-level techniques. Patients may need emotional-level techniques to change their core beliefs at the emotional level. THE C ORE B El IEf WORk SHEETHaving identified the old core belief and developed a new one, you may introduce the Core Belief Worksheet (CBW; see Figure 14. 3), or draw a modified chart. Patients fill out the CBW in session and for homework as they moni -tor the operation of their beliefs and reframe evidence that seemed to support the old belief. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, let me show you a Core Belief Worksheet, which is just an organized way of working on your beliefs. I’d like us to keep this sheet in front of us during our sessions to see whether the topic we’re discussing is relevant to competency. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: Learning to fill out this sheet takes time and practice, just as it took you a while to get good at the Thought Record. Okay? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: All right. Is it okay if we start with the right side, evidence that you’re incompetent? pa Ti e n T: Sure. Already described Additional techniques Socratic questioning techniques Core Belief Worksheet Examining advantages and disadvantages Extreme contrasts Intellectual–emotional role plays Stories and metaphors Acting “as if” Historical tests Behavioral experiments Restructuring early memories Cognitive continuum Coping cards Self-disclosure FIGURE 14. 2. Techniques to modify core beliefs. Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 243 Th e r a p i s T: Okay, think over what you did today . What evidence do you have that you’re incompetent? pa Ti e n T: Well, I didn’t understand something my economics professor presented in class today. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, write that down on the right side, then put a big “BUT” next to it. Now, let’s think if there could be another explana -tion for why you might not have understood the concept other than that you’re incompetent. pa Ti e n T: Well, it was the first time she talked about it. And it wasn’t in the readings. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Now might you be able to understand it after she has reviewed it, or you’ve read something about it, or asked some -one else to explain it better? pa Ti e n T: Probably. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. Now next to the “BUT” you’ll write what we call the “reframe”—another, more helpful way of looking at the evidence. What could you say here? Evidence supporting new core belief I’m competent but human Evidence supporting old core belief I’m incompetent with reframe Did well on literature paper. Asked a question in statistics. Understand this worksheet. made decisions about next year. Arranged to switch phones, bank accounts, insurance, etc. Got together all the references I need for econ paper. Understood most of Chapter 6 in statistics book. Explained statistics concept to guy down the hall. Didn’t understand econ concept in class BUT I hadn’t read about it and I’ll probably understand it later. At worst it’s an incompetency but maybe it’s actually her fault for not explaining it well enough. Didn’t go to the teaching assistant for help BUT that doesn’t mean I’m incompetent. I was nervous about going because I think I should be able to figure out these things myself and I thought he’d think I was unprepared. Got a B on my literature paper, BUT it’s an okay grade. If I were really incompetent, I wouldn’t even be here. FIGURE 14. 3. Sally’s Core Belief Worksheet. From Cognitive behavior therapy work -sheet packet . Copyright 2011 by Judith S. Beck. Bala Cynwyd, PA: Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy. 244 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: I guess I could say, “But I hadn’t read about it, and I’ll prob -ably understand it later. ”Th e r a p i s T: Okay, write that down . . . Now let’s see if we can make the reframe even stronger. Would you agree that not understanding a concept at worst means a person has an incompetency, not that she’s completely incompetent as a person? pa Ti e n T: Yes, that’s true. Th e r a p i s T: Is it possible that many competent people don’t necessarily grasp concepts at the first presentation? pa Ti e n T: True. Th e r a p i s T: I wonder, is it possible that it was actually an incompetency of the professor , because if she had explained it more clearly, you might have understood it? pa Ti e n T: That’s possible. Th e r a p i s T: Why don’t you take a minute and see if there is anything else you want to add in writing? . . . Okay, let’s try the left side now. What evidence do you have from today that you are competent at many things? I’ll warn you, this can be hard if your screen is oper -ating. pa Ti e n T: Well, I worked on my literature paper. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Write that down. What else? pa Ti e n T: I asked a question in my statistics course. Th e r a p i s T: You did! Good. What else? pa Ti e n T: (No response . )Th e r a p i s T: How about the fact that you seem to grasp how to do this worksheet? pa Ti e n T: I guess so. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, how about for homework if you try to add to this sheet every day? Can you see that to start, doing the first part of the right side will be easiest, but the second part and the left side will probably be harder? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: So do what you can. It may be that we’ll have to work together to do the reframes and look for positive evidence. I’ll give you a clue, though. If you have trouble with these two parts, pre -tend someone else, your roommate, for example, has done exactly what you’ve done, and see how you’d view her actions. Okay? pa Ti e n T: Sure. Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 245 Th e r a p i s T: Can you think of anything that might get in the way of your doing this assignment this week? pa Ti e n T: No, I’ll try it. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Had Sally displayed difficulty in identifying positive data during the session, I might have postponed this homework assignment, trying dif -ferent techniques in session first to help her successfully elicit items for the left side. For example, I might use a contrasting technique:Th e r a p i s T: How about the fact that you battled your way through the student health system so you would get seen right away? Doesn’t that belong on the left side? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. I was just so mad; it was easy. Th e r a p i s T: Wait a minute. If you hadn’t asserted yourself, wouldn’t you have put that on the right side as a sign of incompetence? pa Ti e n T: Probably. Th e r a p i s T: So think of it this way: Anything that you would criticize yourself for or put on the right side if you didn’t do it probably belongs on the left. Other ways of having patients recognize positive data that belong on the left side of the worksheet include asking patients: 1. To think of data that they would say were positive evidence for another person: “Sally, can you think of someone else who you consider is competent in most ways? Who would that be? What have you done today that you would say shows that [this person] is competent if she or he had done it? ”2. To name another person who would say the data indicate positive evidence about the patient: “Sally, who’s someone you think knows you pretty well, whose judgment you trust? What would [this person] say you had done today that’s evidence you’re competent? ” or “Sally, what have you done today that I probably think indicates you’re competent? ”3. To reflect on whether they would discount specific positive evidence if they compared what they did to a hypothetical negative model: “Sally, you don’t believe that finishing that brief paper is a sign of competence. But would a truly incompetent person have 246 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND been able to write it? Would a truly incompetent person even have made it to where you are now? ”4. To rate the strength of their beliefs at the intellectual and emotional levels at the beginning of each session, before setting the agenda. Then you can ask, “When you believed least strongly that you were incompetent or most strongly that you were competent, what was going on? Is this something we should put on the agenda? ” Discussing these (more positive) situations provides an opportunity to gather or reinforce evidence for the left side. You may also take the opportunity throughout the session to ques -tion patients about the applicability of the CBW to the topic at hand. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, can you summarize what we’ve just been talking about? pa Ti e n T: Well, I was pretty down because I didn’t get the summer job I wanted, and where anyone would probably be disappointed, I got pretty depressed because I was thinking it meant that I was incom -petent. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Can you see how this is relevant to the Core Belief Worksheet? pa Ti e n T: Yes. It’s the same idea. Th e r a p i s T: How can you write it down on the worksheet? pa Ti e n T: I guess it goes on the right side . . . I didn’t get the research assistant job . . . but that doesn’t mean I’m completely incompetent. A lot of people applied for it, some with lots more experience than me. Using Extreme Contrasts to Modify Core Beliefs At times, it is helpful for patients to compare themselves with someone, either real or imagined, who is at a negative extreme of the quality related to their core belief. You suggest that patients imagine someone within their frame of reference. (This technique is similar to the cogni -tive continuum described in Chapter 13. )Th e r a p i s T: I wonder, do you know anyone at your school who truly is incompetent or at least behaves very incompetently? pa Ti e n T: Ummm . . . There is one guy in my dorm who never, I think, Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 247 goes to classes or does work. He just seems to party all the time. I think he’s failing. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, so compared to him, how incompetent are you? pa Ti e n T: (Pauses . ) Not very. Th e r a p i s T: If you truly were an incompetent person, through and through, what would you be doing differently? pa Ti e n T: . . . I guess I’d drop out of college, sit around all day . . . not support myself . . . not do anything worthwhile . . . not have any friends . . . Th e r a p i s T: How close are you to that now? pa Ti e n T: Not at all, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: So how accurate would you say it is to label yourself as truly incompetent? pa Ti e n T: I guess it’s really not accurate. Using Stories, Movies, and Metaphors You can help patients develop a different idea about themselves by encouraging them to reflect on their view of characters or people who share the same negative core belief. When patients experience vivid examples of the invalidity of others’ very strongly held core beliefs, they begin to understand how they, too, could have a very strong core belief that is not accurate. One patient was sure that she was bad because as a child, and later as an adult, her mother had been physically and emotionally abusive to her, often telling the patient how bad she was. It was helpful for this patient to reflect on the story of Cinderella, in which a wicked step -mother treats a child quite badly without the child’s being at fault. Historical Tests of the Core Belief When patients’ core beliefs stem from early experiences, it is often use -ful to have them examine how their belief originated and was main -tained through the years (Young, 1999). You elicit and help patients reframe evidence that seemed to support the core belief from an early age, and also to uncover evidence that contradicted it. (You can use the CBW to collect data. ) Usually, this process is initiated after patients have been monitoring the operation of their core belief in the present and have started the process of modifying it. First you provide a ratio -nale: 248 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Sally, I’d like to see where this idea that you’re incompe -tent started. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: Let’s pull out the Core Belief Worksheet. Do you remember anything when you were quite young that made you believe at the time that you were incompetent? Say, before elementary school? pa Ti e n T: I remember preschool. I remember doing something with puzzles and the teacher yelling at me. I was crying . . . Th e r a p i s T: Were you slow to finish it? pa Ti e n T: Yes, something like that. Th e r a p i s T: And you felt pretty incompetent? pa Ti e n T: Uh-huh. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, write that down on the right-hand side. We’ll fill in the reframes later. What else? pa Ti e n T: I remember this time my family went to the state park. Every -one else could ride their bikes around, but I couldn’t keep up, and I got left really far behind. Either in session or for homework, patients continue this first step: recording memories that may have contributed to the establishment or maintenance of the core belief. They may reflect on preschool, elemen -tary school, high school, college, their 20 s, and succeeding decades. The second step of the historical review involves searching for and recording evidence that supports the new, positive belief for each period. Having evoked more positive memories, patients are ready for the third step: reframing each piece of negative evidence. Finally, in the fourth step, patients summarize each period. For example:High School Years—I did a lot of things competently, from sports to being responsible for a lot of things at home to doing well at school. It’s true that I didn’t get all A’s, and I wasn’t good at everything, and I felt incompetent at times, but basically I was competent. Restructuring Early Memories For many Axis I patients, the “intellectual” techniques that have already been presented are sufficient to modify a core belief, as long as they are employed in the presence of emotion (i. e. , that the core belief has been activated and the patient is experiencing negative affect). For oth -ers, special “emotional” or experiential techniques, in which patients’ Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 249 affect is aroused, are also indicated. One such technique involves role-playing, reenacting an event to help patients reinterpret an earlier, traumatic experience. In the transcript that follows, I help a patient restructure the meaning of an earlier event related to a current distress-ing situation. Th e r a p i s T: Annie, you look pretty down today. pa Ti e n T: Yes. ( crying ) . . . My boss called me into his office this after-noon. He said I made a couple of typos in an e-mail I sent out for him, and that I have to be more careful and proofread my e-mails better. Th e r a p i s T: What went through your mind when he said that? pa Ti e n T: I’m a terrible secretary. I can’t do anything right. Th e r a p i s T: How are you feeling? pa Ti e n T: [expressing her emotion] Sad. Real sad. [expressing her core belief] And, you know, incompetent. Th e r a p i s T: In proofreading some e-mails or overall? pa Ti e n T: Overall, I’m completely incompetent. Th e r a p i s T: [heightening her affect to facilitate memory retrieval] Do you feel this sadness and incompetency somewhere in your body? pa Ti e n T: Behind my eyes. And my shoulders feel heavy. Instead of focusing on this current situation, I elicit a past experi-ence with the same theme. First we talk about it on the intellectual level. Th e r a p i s T: When is the first time you remember feeling this way, as a kid? pa Ti e n T: (pause ) When I was 6. I was in first grade. I remember I brought home my report card, and I was a little scared because I hadn’t done very well. My dad was okay about it, but my mom got pretty mad. Th e r a p i s T: What did she say? pa Ti e n T: She yelled, “Annie, what am I going to do with you? Just look at this report card! ”Th e r a p i s T: What did you say? pa Ti e n T: I don’t think I said anything. My mom kept saying, “Don’t you know what will happen if you don’t get good grades? Your brother always does well. Why can’t you? I’m so ashamed of you. What are you going to amount to? ”Th e r a p i s T: [empathizing] You must have felt pretty bad. 250 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: I did. Th e r a p i s T: Do you think this was a reasonable way for her to act? pa Ti e n T: (Thinks . ) No . . . I guess not. Th e r a p i s T: Well, is this something you’d say to your own kids some day? pa Ti e n T: No. I’d never say that. Th e r a p i s T: What would you say if you had a 6-year-old daughter who brought home a report card like that? pa Ti e n T: Ummm . . . I guess I’d say what my father did, “That’s okay. Don’t feel bad. I didn’t do great in school either, and it didn’t mat -ter one bit. ”Th e r a p i s T: That’s good. Do you have any idea why your mother didn’t say that? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: I wonder, from what you’ve told me before, if it could be because she thought other people might look down on her if her kids didn’t do well. pa Ti e n T: That’s probably right. She was always bragging about my brother to her friends. I think she was always trying to keep up with the Joneses. Next I change the focus of our discussion so the patient can engage in experiential learning:Th e r a p i s T: Okay, how about if we do a role play. I’ll play you at age 6; you play your mom. Try to see things from her point of view as much as you can. I’ll start . . . Mom, here’s my report card. pa Ti e n T: Annie, I’m ashamed of you. Look at these grades. What am I going to do with you? Th e r a p i s T: Mom, I’m only 6. My grades aren’t great like Robert’s, but they’re okay. pa Ti e n T: Don’t you know what will happen if you don’t get good grades? You’ll never amount to anything. Th e r a p i s T: That’s silly, Mom. I’m only 6. pa Ti e n T: But next year, you will be 7, and after that 8 . . . Th e r a p i s T: Mom, I didn’t do that bad. Why are you making such a big deal? You’re making me feel like I’m completely incompetent. Is that what you mean to do? pa Ti e n T: No, of course not. I don’t want you to think that. It’s not true. I just want you to do better. Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 251 Next I help the patient draw a different conclusion about the expe -rience:Th e r a p i s T: Okay, out of role. What do you think? pa Ti e n T: I wasn’t really incompetent. I did okay. Mom probably was hard on me because she didn’t want to be criticized. Th e r a p i s T: How much do you believe that? pa Ti e n T: I think I do believe it. Th e r a p i s T: How about if we do the role play again, but this time we’ll switch parts. Let’s see how well the 6-year-old Annie can talk back to her mother. Following this second role play, I ask Annie what she learned, and how this learning applies to the situation that upset her this week (get -ting criticized by her boss). Another technique uses imagery to restructure early memories in the presence of affect (J. S. Beck, 2005; Edwards, 1989; Layden, New -man, Freeman, & Morse, 1993; Smucker & Dancu, 1999; Young, Klosko, & Weishaar, 2006). This Gestalt type technique has been adapted spe -cifically to change core beliefs and is more often used with patients with personality disorders than with Axis I patients. In the following case example, I help a patient reexperience an early distressing event that seems to have contributed to the origin or maintenance of a key core belief. I do the following:1. Identify a specific situation that is currently quite distressing to the patient and seems linked to an important core belief. 2. Heighten the patient’s affect by focusing on automatic thoughts, emotions, and somatic sensations linked with this situation. 3. Help the patient identify and reexperience a relevant early experience. 4. Talk to the “younger” part of the patient to identify automatic thoughts, emotions, and beliefs. 5. Help the patient develop a different understanding of the experience through guided imagery, Socratic questioning, dialogue, and/or role play. In the following transcript, Annie reports an upsetting experi -ence from the previous day in which she felt criticized by women in her church group with whom she was working on a fundraising project. 252 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Can you imagine this scene again, as if it’s happening right now? You’re all sitting around the table . . . (I have Annie vividly pic -ture and describe the distressing incident in the present tense . )pa Ti e n T: Peggy is saying, “Annie, you’ve got to go back to the stores and find out who the managers or owners are and talk to them about contributing—the clerks don’t have the authority. ” And I’m feeling so down, so sad. [I’m thinking] “I’m letting everyone down. I’m not good enough. I can’t do anything right. ”Th e r a p i s T: Are you feeling the sadness right now? pa Ti e n T: (Nods . )Th e r a p i s T: [questioning her about her physiological response to heighten her affective response] Where in your body do you feel it? pa Ti e n T: Behind my eyes. Th e r a p i s T: Anywhere else? Where else is the sadness? pa Ti e n T: In my chest . . . and my stomach. There’s a heaviness. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, can you focus on the heaviness? Can you really feel it now, in your stomach, in your chest? And behind your eyes? pa Ti e n T: (Nods . )Th e r a p i s T: Okay, just focus on your eyes, your stomach, your chest . . . (Waits about 10 seconds . ) Annie, when do you remember feeling this heaviness before, when you were a kid? When’s the first time you remember feeling like this? In the next section, I have Annie relate a distressing, significant memory with the same theme as the current upsetting experience. Annie describes (in the past tense) how critical her mother was when Annie stayed up late to do a homework assignment in second grade and how incompetent she felt. I then ask Annie to relate this experience again, this time telling it to me as her younger self, as if experience is happening right now. I interview the “child” part of Annie, continually reinforcing the emotional immediacy of the experience by having the patient use the present tense throughout. Th e r a p i s T: Seven-year-old Annie, where are you? pa Ti e n T: I’m home. In the kitchen. I’m doing my homework. Th e r a p i s T: Is it hard? pa Ti e n T: Yes. I don’t know what to do. Th e r a p i s T: [asking questions to deepen the experience, affect, and cognitions] Can you see your mom come into the kitchen? How does she look? Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 253 pa Ti e n T: She looks mad. Really mad. Th e r a p i s T: How can you tell? pa Ti e n T: (Eyes begin to tear . ) Her face is scrunched up. It’s all red. Th e r a p i s T: What is she saying to you? pa Ti e n T: “Annie, go to bed. ”Th e r a p i s T: Keep going. pa Ti e n T: “Mom, I can’t. I have to finish this. ”Th e r a p i s T: What is Mom saying? pa Ti e n T: “Get to bed! What’s the matter with you? This stuff is easy. Are you stupid? ” ( Sobs. )Th e r a p i s T: (gently ) Seven-year-old Annie, how are you feeling? pa Ti e n T: Sad. ( Cries a little . )Th e r a p i s T: Real sad? pa Ti e n T: (Nods . )Th e r a p i s T: (softly ) Seven-year-old Annie, what’s going through your mind right now? pa Ti e n T: I am stupid. I can’t do anything right. Th e r a p i s T: How much do you believe that? ( gesturing with her hands ) A little? A medium amount? A whole lot? pa Ti e n T: A whole lot. Th e r a p i s T: What else are you thinking? pa Ti e n T: I’ll never be able to do stuff right. Note that the intensification of Annie’s affect verifies this as a core issue. In the next section, I help Annie reinterpret this experience. Th e r a p i s T: Seven-year-old Annie, I’d like to help you see this in a dif -ferent way. Is it okay if we get your older self to come talk to you? pa Ti e n T: (Nods . )Th e r a p i s T: Okay, 7-year-old Annie, can you imagine that your mom walks out of the kitchen and your 45-year-old self walks in? Where would you like her to be? pa Ti e n T: Next to me, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: Real close? pa Ti e n T: (Nods . )Th e r a p i s T: Would you like her to put her arm around you? pa Ti e n T: (Nods . ) 254 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Okay. Let’s have older Annie talk to 7-year-old Annie. Have her ask 7-year-old Annie what’s wrong. pa Ti e n T: What’s wrong? Th e r a p i s T: What does 7-year-old Annie say? pa Ti e n T: I feel so stupid. I can’t do anything right. Th e r a p i s T: What does your older self answer back? pa Ti e n T: No, you’re not. This homework is too hard. It’s not your fault. You’re not stupid. Th e r a p i s T: What does 7-year-old Annie say? pa Ti e n T: But I should be able to do it. Th e r a p i s T: Have your older self keep talking to her. pa Ti e n T: No, that’s not true. You shouldn’t be able to do it. You’ve been absent. You were never taught this. Actually, it’s your teacher’s fault for giving you something too hard. Th e r a p i s T: Seven-year-old Annie, do you believe her? pa Ti e n T: A little. Th e r a p i s T: Seven-year old Annie, what do you want to ask your older self? pa Ti e n T: Why does everything have to be so hard? Why can’t I do any -thing right? Th e r a p i s T: What does older Annie say? pa Ti e n T: You do lots of things right. Some things like math papers are easy, and getting dressed all by yourself and playing soccer . . . Th e r a p i s T: Seven-year-old Annie, what are you thinking? pa Ti e n T: But I can’t play soccer well. Robert is so much better. Th e r a p i s T: Older Annie, help her understand. pa Ti e n T: Listen, he is better at baseball than you. But he’s older. When he was your age, he could only do what you can do now. You’ll get better, just wait. Th e r a p i s T: Seven-year-old Annie, how are you feeling now? When Annie reports that her younger self is feeling significantly less sad, I wrap up the exercise (e. g. , “Is there anything else you want to ask your older self, 7-year-old Annie? ”). I then ask Annie to write down the old belief that was activated in this memory and the new belief, and to rate how much she now believes each one at an intellectual level and at an emotional level. Then we discuss the present distressing incident involving her friend Peggy and the church group, and help Annie draw a more real - Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 255 ity-based, adaptive conclusion. By the end of the session, Annie believes only 20% that she is incompetent and 70% that she is competent. She believes an alternative explanation quite strongly: that her contribution may not live up to Peggy’s expectations, but that does not mean that she is incompetent. This was her first experience with fundraising, and the more experienced members had not given her enough information. Even if someone else in the group could have done a better job, it does not mean that Annie is completely incompetent as a person. In summary, core beliefs require consistent, systematic work. A number of techniques applicable to restructuring automatic thoughts and intermediate beliefs may be used along with more specialized tech -niques oriented specifically toward core beliefs. Additional strategies to modify core beliefs can be found in J. S. Beck (2005), Beck and col -leagues (2004), and Young (1999). Typical core beliefs of patients with a variety of psychiatric disorders are described in Riso, du Toit, Stein, and Young (2007). 256 Chapter 15 ADDITIONAl COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAl TECHNIQUESA number of cognitive and behavioral techniques have previously been introduced, among them Socratic questioning, behavioral experiments, intellectual–emotional role-playing, Core Belief Work-sheets, imagery, and listing advantages and disadvantages of beliefs. This chapter describes other important techniques, many of which are both cognitive and behavioral in nature. As described more fully in Chapter 19, you will choose techniques according to your overall conceptualization and goals for a particular session. You will also cre-ate your own techniques as you become more profi cient as a cognitive behavior therapist. The techniques described in this chapter, as is the case for all cog-nitive behavior therapy techniques, aim to infl uence the patient’s think-ing, behavior, mood, and physiological arousal. They include problem solving, making decisions, refocusing, relaxation and mindfulness, coping cards, graded task assignments, exposure, role play, the “pie” technique, self-comparisons, and credit lists. Additional techniques are described in various sources (Beck et al. , 1979; Beck & Emery, 1985; Leahy, 2003; Mc Mullin, 1986). PROBl Em SOl VING AND Sk Ill S TRAININGAssociated with or in addition to their psychological disorders, patients have real-life problems. At every session, you will encourage patients to Additional Techniques 257 put on the agenda problems that have come up during the week that still distress them and problems they anticipate in the coming weeks. You will encourage patients to devise solutions to their problems, ask -ing them how they have solved similar problems in the past, or how they might advise a close friend or family member to solve the same kind of problem. You will then offer potential solutions, if needed. To spur your thinking, you might ask yourself how you have solved or would have solved a similar problem. Some patients are deficient in problem-solving skills. They may benefit from direct instruction in problem solving, where they learn to specify a problem, devise solutions, select a solution, implement it, and evaluate its effectiveness (see, e. g. , D’Zurilla & Nezu, 2006). And many patients also have skill deficits. They require skills training from you or from an outside source in such areas as effective parenting, job interviewing, budgeting, and relationship skills. Self-help books can be useful; for example, Mc Kay, Davis, and Fanning (2009) offer a client guide to improving communication. Other patients, however, already have good problem-solving and other skills. They may need help in testing dysfunctional beliefs that impede problem solving or using the skills they already possess. A prob -lem-solving worksheet (J. S. Beck, 2011) helps patients specify a prob -lem and identify and respond to interfering cognitions before discuss -ing potential solutions. Sally, for example, had difficulty concentrating when she was study -ing. She and I brainstormed solutions. She could start with the easiest assignment first, review relevant class notes before reading the text -book, write down questions when she was unsure of her understanding, and pause every few minutes to rehearse mentally what she had just read. We agreed she would try these strategies as experiments to see which, if any, facilitated her concentration and comprehension. A few sessions later, Sally put her volunteer job on the agenda. She had started tutoring a child at a nearby elementary school. Although the child was cooperative, Sally felt unsure of what she was doing. Intel -lectually she knew how to solve the problem; she realized she should contact the agency that coordinated the volunteers and/or the child’s teacher. Her belief that she should not ask for help, however, inhibited her. After evaluating her automatic thoughts and beliefs about this spe -cific situation, Sally implemented the solution she herself had initially conceived. I used self-disclosure to help Sally when she brought up the prob -lem of procrastination. She was avoiding doing research for a paper she had to write. I told her that I often find the few moments or minutes just before starting a task I was avoiding the most unpleasant. Once I actually start doing the task, I invariably feel better. Sally recognized 258 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND that she often had the same experience, and we set up a behavioral experiment to see what would happen later that afternoon when she went online to start her research. Some problem solving may involve significant life changes. After careful evaluation of a situation, you might encourage battered spouses to seek refuge or take legal action. If you have patients who are chroni -cally dissatisfied with their job, you might guide them in analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of staying in their current job ver -sus looking for another job. Not all problems, of course, can be ame -liorated. In such cases, however, patients may be able to change their response to problems by modifying their cognitions. They may need to accept the status quo and work on making other aspects of their lives more satisfying. Some patients are chronic worriers about problems that are highly unlikely to occur. For these patients, you may need to help them differ -entiate between low-probability and higher-probability problems and between taking reasonable and unreasonable precautions. You also need to help them accept uncertainty, recognize and build personal and external resources, and increase their sense of self-efficacy, so they will have more confidence that if problems do arise, they will be able (by themselves or with the help of others) to handle them. m Ak ING D ECISIONSMany patients, especially those who are depressed, have difficulty mak -ing decisions. When patients want your help in this area, you will ask them to list the advantages and disadvantages of each option and then help them devise a system for weighing each item and drawing a conclu -sion about which option seems best (see Figure 15. 1). Th e r a p i s T: You mentioned that you wanted help in deciding whether to go to summer school or to get a job? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. ( Pulls out a piece of paper . ) Let me show you how to weigh advantages and disadvantages. Have you ever done that? pa Ti e n T: No. At least not in writing. I’ve been going over some of the pros and cons in my head. Th e r a p i s T: Good. That’ll help us get started. I think you’ll find that writing them down will make the decision clearer. Which one do you want to start with—school or a job? pa Ti e n T: Getting a job, I guess. Additional Techniques 259 Th e r a p i s T: Okay. Write “Advantages of job” at the top left of this paper and “Disadvantages of job” on the top right, and “Advantages of summer school” and “Disadvantages of summer school” at the bot -tom. pa Ti e n T: (Does so . ) Okay. Th e r a p i s T: What have you been thinking? Could you jot down some advantages and disadvantages of getting a job? ( Sally writes down the ideas she has had so far. I ask some questions to guide her . ) How about the fact that you’d be doing something different—taking a break from schoolwork—is that an advantage? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. ( Writes it down . )Th e r a p i s T: Would a job cut into your vacation time? pa Ti e n T: No, I’d only take a job that would let me spend the last 2 weeks of August with my family. Sally and I continue this process until she feels she has recorded both sides fairly and thoroughly. We repeat the process with the second option. Examining advantages and disadvantages of summer school reminds Sally of additional items to add to the “job” lists. Likewise, she also reviews the “job” items to see whether their counterparts are relevant to the “summer school” lists. Next, I help Sally evaluate the items:Advantages of job Disadvantages of job 1. m ake money. 2. m aybe learn skills. 3. Break from what I’ve been doing. 4. m eet different people. 5. m ake me feel more productive. 6. Good for resumé. 1. Have to find one. 2. l ess free time. 3. m ight not like it. Advantages of summer school Disadvantages of summer school 1. Two friends are going. 2. Could take one less course in the fall. 3. l ots of free time. 4. It’s a known quantity. 5. Could meet new people. 6. Easier to enroll than to find a job. 1. Not making money and it costs money. 2. Doesn’t increase my skills. 3. m ore of the same of what I’ve been doing. 4. Doesn’t make me feel as productive. 5. Doesn’t help my resumé. FIGURE 15. 1. Sally’s advantages–disadvantages analysis. 260 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Okay, this looks pretty complete. Now you need to weigh the items in some way. Do you want to circle the most important items—or rate the importance of each one on a 1–10 scale? pa Ti e n T: Circle the items, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, let’s look at the “job” lists. Which items are most important to you? ( Sally circles items in each column in Figure 15. 1 . ) Just looking over what you’ve circled, what do you think? pa Ti e n T: I’d like to get a job, because if I had one, I’d make money and feel productive, and it would be good to get a break from school. But it feels like it would be really hard to get one. Th e r a p i s T: Should we spend a few minutes now talking about how you might go about looking for a job? Then we can come back to this list and see if you’re still leaning that way. At the end of the discussion, I increase the probability that Sally will use this technique again:Th e r a p i s T: Did you find this [process of listing and weighing advan -tages and disadvantages] useful? Can you think of any other deci -sions you might have to make where it would be good to do the same thing? How will you remember to do it this way? REf OCUSINGAs described in Chapter 11, it is often best for patients to evaluate their automatic thoughts on the spot and evaluate them or read relevant therapy notes. In some situations, however, this strategy is unfeasible or undesirable, and refocusing their attention is indicated. Refocusing is particularly useful when concentration is needed for the task at hand, such as completing a work assignment, carrying on a conversation, or driving. It is also useful when patients are having obsessive thoughts for which rational evaluation is ineffective. You will teach patients to label and accept their experience: “I’m just having automatic thoughts. I can accept the fact that I’m having them and that I’m feeling badly and refocus on what I was doing. ” Then patients should deliberately turn their attention to the report they are writing, to what their fellow conversationalists are saying, to the road ahead. You will rehearse the strategy with them, trying to elicit how they have refocused their atten -tion in the past or how they believe they could in the future. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, so one alternative when you’re feeling anxious in class is to answer back those thoughts. But sometimes you may be Additional Techniques 261 better off just changing your focus to what’s going on in class. Have you done this before, made an effort to concentrate on the class? pa Ti e n T: Ah . . . yeah, I guess so. Th e r a p i s T: How did you do that? pa Ti e n T: Well, it helps if I start taking lots of notes. Th e r a p i s T: Good. How about this week if you try not to let yourself just feel overwhelmed by your negative thoughts and anxiety and sad -ness, but instead either answer back your thoughts, or refocus and take lots of notes, or both. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: How will you remember to do that? At other times, patients may be too distressed to refocus their attention on a task, or may not have a specific task to which to attend. Distracting activities can be useful in these circumstances. While dis -traction is not the ultimate solution, it can be a helpful short-term tech -nique. Again, elicit what has worked for the patient in the past and then offer other suggestions, if needed. Th e r a p i s T: So you got really worked up about the report you have to write? pa Ti e n T: Yes, I couldn’t concentrate. I just got more and more anx -ious. Th e r a p i s T: What did you do? pa Ti e n T: I just started to pace around my room. Th e r a p i s T: Did that help? pa Ti e n T: Not really. Th e r a p i s T: Did you try to answer back your thoughts? pa Ti e n T: I read my therapy notes, but they didn’t help. I didn’t believe them, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: (Jots down a note . ) Let’s try to figure out why they weren’t helpful in a few minutes, but first let me ask you, how long were you anxious? pa Ti e n T: A long time. I don’t know, maybe a couple of hours. I kept going back to my desk to try to read, but I just couldn’t. Th e r a p i s T: Did you try to distract yourself? pa Ti e n T: No. I finally decided not to try and I just went to dinner. Th e r a p i s T: Do you ever try to distract yourself? What have you done? pa Ti e n T: Usually, I turn on the TV. 262 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: How well does that usually work? pa Ti e n T: Sometimes I can lose myself and feel better, sometimes not. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, if it doesn’t work well, what else do you try? pa Ti e n T: Sometimes I pick up the newspaper or do a crossword puzzle, but that doesn’t always work either. Th e r a p i s T: Any other ideas? pa Ti e n T: . . . No, not really. Th e r a p i s T: Can I mention some things that other people find helpful? You might try some of these things as an experiment this week: take a walk or go running, call or e-mail a friend or someone in your family, clean your closet or desk, balance your checkbook, go to the grocery store, knock on a neighbor’s door, play a video game, visit your favorite websites . . . What do you think? Do you want to try any of these things this week? pa Ti e n T: Yes. I could do that. Th e r a p i s T: Sometimes people find that soothing activities are better: taking a long bath, listening to uplifting music, reading prayers. What do you think? Would you like to write down a few possibili -ties? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Once you’re feeling less distressed, you may be able to answer your thoughts better, or just return to what you were doing. Now, ultimately, we don’t want you to have to distract yourself. But it may help for now. On the other hand, you may find that patients are distracting themselves too much. If they do not fear negative emotion, the follow -ing type of discussion can be useful. Th e r a p i s T: So, what you’re saying is that you tend to try to push your thoughts out of your mind when you’re feeling upset? Is that right? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: And do these thoughts, for example, that you can’t do something, vanish from your mind completely? pa Ti e n T: No, they usually come back. Th e r a p i s T: So you’re not really pushing them completely out of mind, just to the back of your mind, where they wait for another opportu -nity to pop out and make you miserable? pa Ti e n T: I guess so. Additional Techniques 263 Th e r a p i s T: I wonder this week if you would be willing, at least some of the time, to stop distracting yourself and instead really work on these thoughts, evaluate them as you’ve been learning to do in ses -sion? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: Even if it’s impossible to do a Thought Record at the time, maybe you could do it as soon as you have a free moment. Patients may use distraction to avoid the experience of negative emotion. It is imperative for them to fully understand that they do not need to distract themselves because while feeling upset can feel pain -ful, it is not harmful. If patients consistently distract themselves, they cannot learn this important lesson, and you may need to set up behav -ioral experiments to test their fears about experiencing strong affect. It may be beneficial for you to teach them the AWARE technique on page 197 (Beck & Emery, 1985), in which they are instructed to accept the anxiety, watch it, act with the anxiety, repeat these steps, and expect the best. m EASURING m OODS AND B EHAVIOR USING THE A CTIVITY C HARTFor some patients, it is helpful to use the activity chart, not to schedule activities, but to monitor their moods while engaged in various activi -ties, to look for patterns of occurrence. For example, a patient with an anxiety disorder might fill in the boxes listing activities and rating lev -els of anxiety 0–10 (or mild, moderate, severe). A patient who is chroni -cally irritated or angry might do likewise with an anger scale. Using such a scale is particularly useful for patients who either do not seem to notice small to moderate shifts in affect, or patients who chronically over- or underestimate degrees of emotion. Patients with a problematic behavior such as binge eating, smok -ing, overspending, gambling, substance use, or angry outbursts might record all their activities to investigate patterns of occurrence, or might just record the maladaptive behaviors themselves. REl Ax ATION AND m IND f Ul NESSMany patients benefit from learning relaxation techniques, described in detail elsewhere (Benson, 1975; Davis, Eshelman, & Mc Kay, 2008; Jacobson, 1974). There are several kinds of relaxation exercises, includ - 264 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND ing progressive muscle relaxation, imagery, and controlled breathing. Patients can obtain commercially produced relaxation tapes or you can follow a script and make a recording for them during the session. You should teach relaxation exercises in session, where you can deal with problems and assess efficacy. Be aware that some patients experi -ence a paradoxical arousal effect from relaxation exercises; they actu -ally become more tense and anxious (Barlow, 2002; Clark, 1989). As with all techniques, you will propose that patients try relaxation as an experiment; either it will help reduce anxiety or it will lead to anxious thoughts that can be evaluated. Mindfulness techniques help patients nonjudgmentally observe and accept their internal experiences, without evaluating or trying to change them. A short summary of techniques, particularly for people with rumination, can be found in Leahy (2010). Mindfulness is cur -rently being integrated with cognitive behavior therapy for a number of problems, including psychiatric disorders, medical conditions, and stress (Chiesa & Serretti, 2010 a, 2010 b). For extended discussions of mindfulness, see Hayes and colleagues (2004); Mc Cown, Reibel, and Micozzi (2010); Williams, Teasdale, Segal, and Kabat-Zinn (2007); and Kabat-Zinn (1990). GRADED T ASk ASSIGN m ENTSTo reach a goal, it is usually necessary to accomplish a number of steps along the way. Patients tend to become overwhelmed when they focus on how far they are from a goal, instead of focusing on their current step. A graphic depiction of the steps is often reassuring (see Figure 15. 2). Th e r a p i s T: Sally, it sounds like you get nervous just thinking about voluntarily talking in class, though it’s something you want to be able to do. pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: I wonder how we could break it down into steps; for exam -ple, could you start by just asking a question after class, either to another student or to the professor? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. I guess I could do that. Th e r a p i s T: What could the next step be? ( Guides Sally in identifying the steps presented in Figure 15. 2 . )Th e r a p i s T: Does it still seem scary to think about talking in class? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, some. Additional Techniques 265 Th e r a p i s T: (Draws a staircase . ) Okay, here’s what you have to remem -ber. You’re going to start down here, doing something that’s just a little hard, and you’ll get really comfortable on this step before trying the next step, and so on. And remember, before you try the final step, you’ll have gotten really good at the step just below it. Okay? pa Ti e n T: Uh-huh. Th e r a p i s T: So every time you start thinking about the final goal, how about reminding yourself of this staircase and especially of the step you’re now on, and how you’re going to go up the staircase one step at a time. Do you think that’ll help bring down the anxiety? Ex POSUREDepressed and anxious patients often engage in avoidance, a coping strategy. They may feel hopeless about engaging in certain activities (“It won’t do any good to call my friends. They won’t want to see me”) or fearful (“If I [do this activity], something bad will happen”). The Express an opinionin class Answer a questionin class Ask a questionin class Ask a professora questionafter class Ask another studenta question afterclass FIGURE 15. 2. Breaking down goals into steps. 266 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND avoidance may be quite apparent (e. g. , patients who spend a great deal of time in bed, avoiding self-care activities, household tasks, socializing, and errands. ) Or the avoidance may be more subtle (e. g. , socially anx -ious patients who avoid making eye contact, smiling at others, making small talk, and volunteering their opinions). These latter avoidances are safety behaviors (Salkovskis, 1996) that patients believe will ward off anxiety. While avoidance tends to bring immediate relief (and so is quite reinforcing), it perpetuates the problem. Patients do not get the opportunity to test their automatic thoughts and receive disconfirming data. When patients are anxious and significantly avoidant, you will pro -vide a strong rationale for exposing themselves to feared situations. Help them identify an activity that is associated with low to moderate discomfort and ask them to engage in this activity every day (or even several times a day, if feasible), until their anxiety has decreased signifi -cantly. Then identify a new situation that is just a little more difficult, and encourage frequent exposure until they can do it with relative ease, and so on. You may discuss various coping techniques to use before, during, and after each task: Thought Records, coping cards, or relaxation exer -cises, for example. For particularly avoidant patients, covert rehearsal (pages 303–305) to identify either dysphoric automatic thoughts or excuses not to do an assignment is useful. In addition, you may find that patients are more likely to do daily work on a graded exposure hierarchy if you ask them to fill out a daily monitor, which can be sim -ple, listing just the date, activity, and level of anxiety, or it can be more elaborate (see Figure 15. 3). In a more elaborate monitor, you can also ask patients to record and then cross off predictions that did not come true, a task that further reminds them of the inaccuracy of many of their thoughts. Detailed descriptions of the process used to develop agoraphobic hierarchies can be found in various sources (e. g. , Goldstein & Stainback, 1987). Date Activity Predicted level of anxiety 0–100 Actual level of anxiety 1–100 Predictions 4/4 Asking questions in class 80 50 I won’t be able to do it. Nothing will come out of my mouth. I’ll make a fool of myself. FIGURE 15. 3. Custom-made monitor. Additional Techniques 267 Dobson and Dobson (2009) describe plans for effective exposure ses -sions, possible targets, and factors that decrease the effectiveness of exposure. ROl E-Pl AYINGRole-playing is a technique that can be used for a wide variety of pur -poses. Descriptions of role-playing can be found throughout this vol -ume, including role-playing to uncover automatic thoughts, to develop an adaptive response, and to modify intermediate and core beliefs. Role-playing is also useful in learning and practicing social skills. Some patients have weak social skills in general, or are proficient at one style of communication but lack skills to adapt their style when needed. Sally, for example, is reasonably good at normal social conver -sation and situations that call for a caring, empathic stance. She is far less skilled, however, in situations in which assertion is appropriate. She and I engaged in a number of role plays to practice assertiveness. pa Ti e n T: I don’t even know how I’d begin to talk to my professor. Th e r a p i s T: Well, you want him to help you understand this concept better, right? What would you like to say? pa Ti e n T: . . . I don’t know. Th e r a p i s T: Well, how about if we do a role play. I’ll be you; you play your professor. You can play him as being as unreasonable as you’d like. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: I’ll start: Uh, Professor X, could you explain this concept? pa Ti e n T: (gruffly ) I did that already last week in class. Weren’t you there? Th e r a p i s T: Actually, I was. But I don’t understand it well enough yet. pa Ti e n T: Well, you should go read the chapter in your textbook. Th e r a p i s T: I’ve done that already. It didn’t help enough either. That’s why I’m here now. pa Ti e n T: Okay, what don’t you understand about it? Th e r a p i s T: I tried to think of a specific question before I came, but I couldn’t quite think of how to phrase it. Could you spend a couple of minutes just describing it, and then I can see if I can put it in my own words? 268 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: You know, I don’t have much time now. Why don’t you see someone else in the class? Th e r a p i s T: I’d rather get it straight from you. That’s why I came now during office hours. But if you’d rather, I could come back on Thursday when you have office hours again. pa Ti e n T: This is a simple concept. You should really ask some other student. Th e r a p i s T: I’ll try that first. If I need more help, I’ll come back Thurs -day . . . Okay, out of role. Let’s review what I did and then we can switch roles. Before teaching patients social skills, you should assess the level of skill they already possess. Many patients know precisely what to do and say, but have difficulty using this knowledge because of dysfunctional assumptions (e. g. , “If I express an opinion, I’ll get shot down”; “If I assert myself, the other person will be hurt/get mad/think I’m out of line”). One way of assessing skills is to have patients assume a positive outcome: “If you knew for sure the teaching assistant would be will -ing to talk to you, what would you say? ” “If you really believed it was your right to get help, what would you say? ” “If you knew the professor would back down and realize he was being unreasonable, what would you say? ”Another indication that the problem is associated with dysfunc -tional beliefs rather than with a skill deficit is the patient’s use of these skills in another context. Patients may be quite appropriately assertive at work, for example, but not with friends. In this case, you might not need to use role-playing to teach assertiveness skills (although you could use role-playing to have the patients identify their automatic thoughts while they are being assertive, or to predict thoughts and feelings of the other person when roles are switched). USING THE “P IE” TECHNIQUEIt is often helpful to patients to see their ideas in graphic form. A pie chart can be used in many ways, for instance, helping patients set goals or determining relative responsibility for a given outcome, both of which are illustrated below (see Figure 15. 4). Setting Goals When patients have difficulty specifying their problems and the changes they would like to make in their lives, or when they lack insight into how Additional Techniques 269 imbalanced their lives are, they may benefit from a graphic depiction of their ideal versus actual expenditure of time. Th e r a p i s T: It sounds as if you know your life isn’t quite in balance, but you don’t know what to change—is that right? pa Ti e n T: Yes, I guess so. Th e r a p i s T: How about we draw a pie diagram to help figure it out? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: First, we’ll create a diagram of your life now, then an ideal one. Think about how much time you are actually spending in these areas:Workfriendsfunfamily Other interests Taking care of your physical self Taking care of your household Taking care of your spiritual/cultural/intellectual side Th e r a p i s T: Can you draw a pie and put in divisions to give me a rough idea of how you’re spending your time now? pa Ti e n T: (Does so . )Friends Work/School/Intellectual Side Physical Household Spiritual/Cultural Other Interests Fun Work/School/Intellectual Side Friends Fun Other Interests Spiritual Household Physical Actual Ideal FIGURE 15. 4. Use of pie charts in setting goals. 270 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Okay, next, what would you change about it in an ideal world? pa Ti e n T: Well . . . I guess I’d work less, probably try to have more fun . . . spend more time with friends, exercise more, read more, things like that. Th e r a p i s T: Good. How would that look on this ideal pie? pa Ti e n T: (Fills in “ideal” pie . ) [expressing an automatic thought] But I’m afraid if I spend less time working, I’ll accomplish even less than I am now. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, let’s write down that prediction. Now, you may be right, in which case you could always go back to the amount of work you’re doing now. Or you may be wrong. It’s possible if you work a little less and do more pleasurable things, your mood will improve. If your mood improves, is it possible that you might concentrate better and work more efficiently? What do you think? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: In any case, we can test your prediction and see what hap -pens. pa Ti e n T: I know for a fact that I’m not working too efficiently right now. Th e r a p i s T: Then it may well be that once we get your life back in bal -ance and you’re getting positive inputs from doing things you like, that you’ll be able to do better with less work. Following a discussion such as this, you would work with patients to set specific goals to move their expenditure of time closer to their ideal. Determining Responsibility Another technique allows the patient to see graphically the possible causes for a given outcome (see Figure 15. 5). Th e r a p i s T: Sally, how much do you believe you got a C on your exam because you’re basically incompetent? pa Ti e n T: Oh, close to 100%. Th e r a p i s T: I wonder if there might be any other reasons? pa Ti e n T: . . . Well, there were some things on it that we had never really covered in class. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, anything else? Additional Techniques 271 pa Ti e n T: I missed two classes, so I had to borrow notes, and Lisa’s notes weren’t that good. Th e r a p i s T: Anything else? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. I studied some things a lot that turned out not to be on the exam. Th e r a p i s T: Sounds like you weren’t very lucky in that regard. pa Ti e n T: No, and I hardly studied other things that were on the exam. I guessed wrong. Th e r a p i s T: Any other reason to explain why you didn’t do as well as you would have liked? pa Ti e n T: Hmmm. Can’t think of any. Th e r a p i s T: Did everyone else do pretty well? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. Th e r a p i s T: Would you say it was a hard test? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, too hard. Th e r a p i s T: Would you say the professor had done a really good job of explaining the material? pa Ti e n T: No. I don’t think he did a great job. I had to rely on the read -ings, mostly. A couple of times, I heard people saying that they hadn’t been able to follow what he was talking about. Th e r a p i s T: I wonder if you also might have trouble concentrating because of your depression and anxiety? pa Ti e n T: Definitely. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, let’s see how all this would look graphically. Here’s a pie chart; let’s have you divide up sections to explain why you got a C on the exam, including (1) the professor didn’t teach that great; (2) the test was really hard; (3) you hadn’t guessed right about which material to study; (4) you borrowed class notes that weren’t great; (5) there was material on the exam that wasn’t even covered in class; (6) your depression and anxiety interfered with your con -centration; and (7) at heart, you’re an incompetent person. pa Ti e n T: (Fills in pie diagram [Figure 15. 5]. )Th e r a p i s T: Looks like you divided up the sections pretty evenly. How much do you believe now that you got a C on the exam because you’re an incompetent person? pa Ti e n T: Less. 50%, maybe. Th e r a p i s T: Good. That’s quite a drop. 272 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND When investigating the contribution of alternative explanations, ask patients to estimate the dysfunctional attribution (in this case, “I’m incompetent”) last so they will more fully consider all explanations. SElf-C Om PARISONS AND C REDIT l ISTSPatients with psychiatric disorders have a negative bias in information processing, especially when evaluating themselves. They tend to notice data that could be construed as negative and to ignore, discount, or even forget information that is positive. In addition, they often make dysfunctional comparisons: They compare themselves at present with how they were before the onset of their disorder, or with how they would like to be, or they compare themselves with others who do not have a psychiatric disorder. This negative attentional bias helps to maintain or increase their dysphoria. Changing the Self-Comparison In the following transcript, I help Sally see that her selective negative attention and comparisons are dysfunctional. I then teach her to make more functional comparisons (with herself at her worst point) and to keep a credit list. #1#2#3#4#5#6#7 Incompetence Teacher didn’tteach great Test was hard Badluck Borrowedclassnotes Some materialnot coveredin class Depression andanxiety decreasedconcentration FIGURE 15. 5. Pie chart for causality. Additional Techniques 273 Th e r a p i s T: Sally, it sounds as if you’re pretty down on yourself. Do you think there’s anything you did this week that you deserve credit for? pa Ti e n T: Well, I did finish my lit paper. Th e r a p i s T: Anything else? pa Ti e n T: Ummm . . . can’t think of anything. Th e r a p i s T: I wonder whether you might not have noticed some things. pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. Th e r a p i s T: For instance, how many classes did you go to? pa Ti e n T: All of them. Th e r a p i s T: In how many did you take notes? pa Ti e n T: All of them. Th e r a p i s T: Was that easy to do? Or did you have to push yourself to go and concentrate? pa Ti e n T: It was hard. But I should have been able to do it easily. No one else probably had to push. Th e r a p i s T: Oh . . . Sounds as if you might be comparing yourself with other people again. Do you do that a lot? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, I guess so. Th e r a p i s T: Does that seem like a fair comparison to you? Would you be as hard on yourself, for example, if you had to push yourself to go to class and concentrate if you had pneumonia? pa Ti e n T: No, I’d have a legitimate reason to be tired. Th e r a p i s T: Exactly. I wonder if you have a legitimate reason to be tired now? Maybe you do deserve credit when you push yourself. Do you remember at the first session when we talked about the symptoms of depression: tiredness, low energy, trouble concentrating, distur -bances in sleep and appetite, and so on? pa Ti e n T: Uh-huh. Th e r a p i s T: So maybe you do deserve credit for pushing ahead, given that you are depressed? pa Ti e n T: I hadn’t thought of it that way. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, let’s go over two things now: what to do when you compare yourself with others, and how to keep track of what you deserve credit for. Okay, what happens to your mood when you compare yourself to others, for example, when you think, “No one else has to push to go to class and take notes? ”pa Ti e n T: I feel pretty bad. 274 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: And what would happen if you said to yourself, “Now wait a minute. That’s not a reasonable comparison. Let me compare myself to me at my worst point, when I was in my room a lot and couldn’t concentrate in class. ”pa Ti e n T: Well, I’d realize that I’m doing more now. Th e r a p i s T: And would your mood get worse? pa Ti e n T: No, probably better. Th e r a p i s T: Would you like to try this comparison for homework? pa Ti e n T: Uh-huh. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, let’s have you write this down on your assignment sheet, “Catch myself when I compare myself to nondepressed peo -ple. Then remind myself this isn’t reasonable, and compare myself to me at my worst point instead. ”Patients may also have automatic thoughts in which they compare themselves at present to where they would like to be (e. g. , “I should be able to read this chapter easily”), or to where they were before they became depressed (e. g. , “This used to be so easy for me”). In this case, help them focus on how far they have progressed since their worst point, rather than on far they are from their best point or on how far they have to go. When patients are at their lowest point, you will modify the approach:Th e r a p i s T: It sounds as if you feel pretty down when you compare yourself with other people, or with how you wish you were. I won -der if it might be helpful at these times to remind yourself that you have a goal list, and that together we’re developing a plan to help you make changes. If you reminded yourself that you and I are a team working to get you to where you want to be, what could hap -pen to your mood? Credit Lists Credit lists are simply daily lists (mental or written) of positive things the patient is doing or items she deserves credit for (see Figure 15. 6). As with all assignments, I first explain the rationale:Th e r a p i s T: Sally, I’d like to describe a homework assignment that I think could help. You know, we’ve talked about how you have lots and lots of self-critical thoughts. And what happens to your mood every time you have a thought like, “I should be doing this better, ” or “I did a lousy job on that”? Additional Techniques 275 pa Ti e n T: I feel worse. Th e r a p i s T: Right. And what would happen, do you think, if you started noticing more good things you’re doing? pa Ti e n T: I’d probably feel better. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, now would you say that it would be reasonable for me to give myself credit if I were tired from either pneumonia or depression, but I pushed ahead anyway and got out of bed and came to work and saw my patients and wrote e-mails and so on? pa Ti e n T: Sure. Th e r a p i s T: Even if I didn’t do these things as well as usual? pa Ti e n T: Well, sure. Th e r a p i s T: Because I suppose I could have stayed in bed and pulled the covers over my head instead. pa Ti e n T: Right. Th e r a p i s T: Now, does that same thing apply to you? Do you deserve credit for pushing ahead? pa Ti e n T: I guess so. Th e r a p i s T: You know, it’s probably hard for you to remember to give yourself credit outside of our session. That’s why I’m suggesting you keep a written list of things you deserve credit for. What do you think? pa Ti e n T: I could try it. Th e r a p i s T: (beginning the assignment in session ) Here, let’s start it now, if that’s okay with you. What do you want to call it—“credit list”? Something else? (Things that I did that were positive or were a little hard but I did them anyway)1. Tried to follow what was said in statistics class. 2. f inished paper and e-mailed it to [the professor]. 3. Talked to Julie at lunch. 4. Called Jeremy to confirm chemistry assignment. 5. Went for a run instead of taking a nap. 6. Read Chapter 5 of econ book. FIGURE 15. 6. Sally’s credit list. 276 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: Credit list is fine. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Now on this list you can either just write positive things you’ve done, or you can think to yourself, “What did I do today that was even a little hard, but I did it anyway? ”pa Ti e n T: Okay. ( Writes down instructions . )Th e r a p i s T: Let’s start with today. What have you already done today? pa Ti e n T: (Writes as she speaks . ) Let’s see, I went to my statistics class . . . it was kind of hard to follow, but I tried . . . I finished my paper and e-mailed it to the professor . . . I talked to my roommate’s friend, who had lunch with us . . . Th e r a p i s T: That’s a good start. How do you feel about doing this every day? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: I think that you’ll remember things ten times better if you write them down immediately. But if you can’t, you might at least try to write things down at lunch, dinner, and before bed. Think you can do that? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: Do you think you need to write down why you’re doing this assignment? pa Ti e n T: No, I’ll remember. It makes me focus on good things, and that makes me feel better. Completing credit lists early in treatment also helps prepare patients for the later task of uncovering positive data for the Core Belief Work -sheet (Chapter 11). In summary, there are many cognitive and behavioral techniques; this volume describes some of the most common. Readers are encour -aged to do additional reading to add to their repertoire. 277 Chapter 16 Im AGERYmany patients experience automatic thoughts not only as unspoken words in their mind, but also in the form of mental pictures or images (Beck & Emery, 1985). Sally had the thought “[My classmate] will think I’m imposing on him if I ask [for a copy of his notes]. ” Upon questioning, I determined that when Sally experienced this thought, she simultaneously envisioned her classmate with an irritated look on his face. This image was an imaginal automatic thought. This chapter demonstrates how to teach patients to identify their spontaneous images and how to intervene therapeutically with both spontaneous and induced images. Although many patients have visual images, few report them. Merely asking about images, even repeatedly, sometimes is not suffi cient to elicit them. Images usually are quite brief and are often upsetting; many patients push them out of mind quite quickly. Failure to identify and respond to upsetting images may result in continued distress for the patient. IDENTIf YING Im AGESYou will need to be alert to the possibility of patients’ thoughts occur-ring in imaginal form, because few patients spontaneously report images and some have diffi culty identifying them even when prompted. In the following transcript, I try to ascertain whether Sally has had a spontaneous image simultaneous with a verbal automatic thought. 278 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: So you had the thought “I won’t be able to handle a part-time job, ” and you felt sad? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: I wonder, when you had that thought, did you get a picture in your head? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure what you mean. Th e r a p i s T: Did “not handling” a job look like something? pa Ti e n T: I guess I pictured myself walking back to my dorm late at night, just feeling overwhelmed and kind of burdened. Th e r a p i s T: Anything else? pa Ti e n T: I was walking really slowly, just feeling exhausted, with a really heavy backpack. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. That picture, or imagining, is what we call an image. At times, patients fail to grasp the concept when the therapist only uses the word “image. ” Synonyms include mental picture, daydream, fantasy, imagining, and memory. Had Sally failed to report an image, I might have tried using one of these different words. Or I might have chosen to help her create an image (if a therapeutic goal for that ses -sion was to help her recognize images). I could have induced a neu -tral or positive image (“Describe for me what the outside of your home looks like, ” or “Imagine you’re walking into this building. What do you see? ”). Or I might have tried to induce an image about a distressing situation, as below:Th e r a p i s T: Did you imagine what your professor might look like when you asked him for help? Did he look happy? pa Ti e n T: I don’t think I pictured what he looked like. Th e r a p i s T: [helping Sally to think very specifically] Could you pic -ture it now? Can you imagine going up to him? When would you approach him, anyway? pa Ti e n T: Oh, probably on Tuesday. That’s when he has office hours. Th e r a p i s T: So he’d be in his office? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: What building is he in? pa Ti e n T: Bennett Hall. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, can you picture it now? It’s Tuesday, you’re coming up to Bennett Hall . . . You’re coming to his office . . . Can you see it in your mind? Is the door open or closed? Imagery 279 pa Ti e n T: Closed. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, can you see yourself knocking on the door? What does he say when he hears your knock? pa Ti e n T: He says, “Come in. ” ( Imitates professor’s gruff voice . )Th e r a p i s T: Okay, can you see yourself go in? What does his face look like? pa Ti e n T: He’s scowling. Th e r a p i s T: And then what happens? ( Sally and I follow the image out to its most distressing point . ) Okay, this scene you’ve just visualized is what we call an “image. ” Do you think you might have had an image like this when you were considering going to see him this week? pa Ti e n T: Maybe . . . I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: How about for homework if you look for images when you realize you’re getting upset, along with looking for automatic thoughts? pa Ti e n T: Okay. EDUCATING P ATIENTS ABOUT Im AGERYSome patients can identify images, but do not report them because their images are graphic and distressing. They may be reluctant to reex -perience the distress or fear you will view them as disturbed. If you suspect either scenario, normalize the experience of images. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, I don’t know whether you are having images. Most people do, but usually they’re more aware of the emotion that accompanies the image than they are of the image itself. Some -times images seem pretty strange, but actually it’s common to have all kinds of images—sad, scary, even violent ones. The only prob -lem is if you think you’re strange for having the images. Can you recall any images you’ve had recently? pa Ti e n T: No, I don’t think so. Th e r a p i s T: Well, we’ve agreed this week that you’re going to be on the lookout for images when you notice your mood changing. If you are having distressing images, I’ll teach you what you can do about them. Normalizing and teaching patients about images helps reduce their anxiety and makes it more likely that they will be able to identify their images. In the previous transcript, I indicate that Sally will learn 280 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND to respond to images, implying that she can gain control over her dis -tress. You must often be diligent in teaching patients to identify images until they “catch on. ” Most patients simply are unaware of images ini -tially, and many therapists, after a few tries, abandon the attempt. If you get a visual image yourself as the patient is describing a situation, you can use the image as a cue to probe further for an image your patient may have experienced:Th e r a p i s T: Sally, as you were just describing how you’re afraid your roommate will react, I got a picture of her in my head, even though I don’t know her. Have you been imagining how she might look when you bring up the problem of noise with her? RESPONDING TO S PONTANEOUS Im AGESWhen patients do have distressing images, there are several strategies you can teach them. The first seven techniques help patients reduce their distress by viewing a situation in a different way; the last one offers temporary respite by having the patient focus on something else. It is important for you to advise patients that they will need to practice the techniques in and out of session to use them effectively. Following Images to Completion This technique is often the most helpful. It can help you and patients conceptualize their problem better, lead to cognitive restructuring of the image, and provide relief. You will encourage patients to continue visualizing a spontaneous image until one of two things occurs: Either patients imagine getting through a crisis and feeling better, or they imagine an ultimate catastrophe, such as death. (In the latter case, you can then explore the feared consequences and meaning of the ultimate catastrophe and intervene further. ) The first transcript illustrates the first scenario; the patient imagines getting through a particular dif -ficulty. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, Sally, can you get that image in mind again? Tell it to me aloud as you imagine it as vividly as you can. pa Ti e n T: I’m sitting in class. My professor is passing out the exam. I’m looking at it. My mind is going blank. I read the first question. Noth -ing is making sense. I see everyone else busy writing. I’m thinking, “I’m paralyzed. I’m going to fail. ” Imagery 281 Th e r a p i s T: And you’re feeling . . . ? pa Ti e n T: Really, really anxious. Th e r a p i s T: Anything else happen? pa Ti e n T: No. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. [providing psychoeducation] This is very typical. You’ve stopped the image at the very worst point, where you’re feel -ing blank and paralyzed. Now I’d like you to imagine what hap -pens next. pa Ti e n T: Hmmm. I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: Well, do you stay that way for the whole hour? pa Ti e n T: No, I guess not. Th e r a p i s T: Can you picture what happens next? . . . If you’re look -ing around and seeing the other students, are you actually para -lyzed? pa Ti e n T: No, I guess not. Th e r a p i s T: What do you see happening next? pa Ti e n T: I look at my exam again, but I can’t focus. Th e r a p i s T: Then what happens? pa Ti e n T: I blink. The first question doesn’t make any sense to me. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, then what? pa Ti e n T: I skip to the next question. I’m not sure of the answer. Th e r a p i s T: Then what? pa Ti e n T: I keep going until I find a question I know something about. Th e r a p i s T: Then what? pa Ti e n T: I guess I write the answer. Th e r a p i s T: Can you see yourself writing the answer? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Then what? pa Ti e n T: I keep going until I find something else I can answer. Th e r a p i s T: Then what? pa Ti e n T: I go back to the first few questions, try to write something. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Then what? pa Ti e n T: Well, eventually I finish as much as I can. Th e r a p i s T: Then what? pa Ti e n T: I hand in the paper. 282 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: And then? pa Ti e n T: I guess I go on to my next class. Th e r a p i s T: And then? pa Ti e n T: I sit down, get out the right notebook. Th e r a p i s T: And how are you feeling in the image now? pa Ti e n T: A little shaky still. I don’t know how I did on the exam. Th e r a p i s T: Better than at the start when you were feeling blank and paralyzed? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Much better. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Let’s review what you did. First, you recognized a distressing image, which you stopped at the absolute worst point. Then you kept imagining what would realistically happen next until you got to the point where you were feeling somewhat better. This is what we call “following the image to completion. ” ( pause ) Do you think it would help to practice this technique? In the previous example, the patient is easily able to identify a rea -sonable outcome. In some cases, the therapist needs to suggest a modi -fication of the scene:Th e r a p i s T: Can you picture what happens next? . . . If you’re looking around and seeing the other students, are you actually paralyzed? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. I feel paralyzed. Th e r a p i s T: What do you see happening next? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. I just keep sitting there, feeling paralyzed. Th e r a p i s T: Do you want to imagine yourself moving around a little in the chair, taking a breath, looking out the window? pa Ti e n T: Uh-huh. Th e r a p i s T: Do you want to rub the back of your neck and stretch, to make yourself less stiff? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, are you ready now in the image to read through the test until something seems familiar? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Are you picturing that? What do you want to imagine hap -pens next? pa Ti e n T: I find an easier question. Th e r a p i s T: What do you want to imagine happens next? Imagery 283 Here I introduce a new element into the image to help Sally get “unstuck” and repeatedly ask her what she wants to imagine. I continue in this vein until she can continue on her own. As mentioned above, sometimes the patient imagines a scene that worsens, often catastrophically. The therapist then asks questions to determine the meaning of the catastrophe and intervenes accordingly. This situation is exemplified by a different patient, Marie. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, Marie, so you see yourself in the car and it’s starting to drift toward the guard rail of the bridge. Now, get as clear a pic -ture in your mind as you can. Then what happens? pa Ti e n T: It’s getting closer. It crashes through. ( Cries softly . )Th e r a p i s T: (gently ) Then what? pa Ti e n T: (crying ) The car is totally wrecked. Th e r a p i s T: (softly ) And you? pa Ti e n T: (crying ) I’m dead. Th e r a p i s T: Then what happens? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. I can’t see past that. ( still crying )Th e r a p i s T: Marie, I think it’ll help if we try to go a little further. What’s the worst part about dying in this crash? pa Ti e n T: My kids. They won’t have a mother anymore. They’ll be just devastated. ( crying harder )Th e r a p i s T: (Waits a moment . ) Do you have an image of them? In this example, following the image to completion leads to a catas -trophe. I keep gently questioning so I can determine the special sig -nificance of the catastrophe. A later example in this chapter, inducing images to provide distance, illustrates one way to deal with this type of problem. In this case, a patient reveals that she has had a new image, of her children at her funeral, feeling utterly devastated. Once again, the patient has cut off an image at the worst point. (See pages 292–293 for an illustration of how the therapist will have the patient imagine her children [doing better] many years in the future. )In summary, two outcomes are possible when following an image to completion. In one instance, the problem is eventually resolved, and the patient feels relief. In the second instance, the problem worsens to a catastrophe, at which point you ask for the meaning of or the worst part about the image, which helps you uncover a new problem. You can then help the patient induce a coping image, described later in this chapter. 284 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Jumping Ahead in Time At times, following an image to completion is ineffective because patients keep imagining more and more obstacles or distressing events with no end in sight. At this point, you might suggest that patients imag -ine themselves at some point in the near future. Th e r a p i s T: [summarizing] Okay, Sally, when you imagine getting started on this paper, you keep seeing how hard it is and how much effort it’s taking and how many problems you’re having with it. Realistically, do you think you’ll eventually finish the paper? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, probably. I might have to work day and night for a long time, though. Th e r a p i s T: How about if you jump ahead in time and imagine finish -ing it. Can you picture that? What does that look like? pa Ti e n T: Well, I guess I see myself reading it over and making one last edit. Then I e-mail it to the professor. Th e r a p i s T: Wait a moment. Can you slow it down a little, really imag -ine the details? pa Ti e n T: Okay. I’m sitting at my desk in my dorm room. It’s like 2 o’clock in the morning. It’s hard to keep my eyes open, but I start at page 1 and proofread my work. I find a few mistakes and I fix them, then save it in a file. I open my e-mail and send it to my professor. Th e r a p i s T: How do you feel in the image now? pa Ti e n T: Relieved . . . like a weight has been taken off my chest. Lighter. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, let’s review what we did. You had an image of your -self starting to work on this paper and the more you imagined, the more problems you saw and the more anxious you were getting. Then you jumped ahead in time and saw yourself finishing it, which made you feel better. How about if we have you write something down about this technique—jumping ahead in time—so you’ll be able to practice it at home, too. Coping in the Image Another technique is to guide patients so they can imagine they are coping with a difficult situation they have spontaneously envisioned. Th e r a p i s T: [summarizing] So you had an image of walking into the [elementary] school library with the student you’ve volunteered to tutor, and you’re feeling at a complete loss? And then the kid acts up and starts making noise, and you feel as if he’s out of control? Imagery 285 pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: So once again, you’ve had an image and left yourself at the worst point? pa Ti e n T: I guess I did. Th e r a p i s T: Can we go through this image again, and this time, see if you can imagine coping with each problem as it arises? pa Ti e n T: Well, first the kid bangs open the library door. I guess I tell him, “Shh. There’s another class in here. ”Th e r a p i s T: And then what? pa Ti e n T: He starts veering over to the books. Th e r a p i s T: So you . . . pa Ti e n T: I guess I take his hand and guide him to a table. The dialogue continues in this way until the patient has successfully coped in the image. If necessary, you can ask leading questions to help them devise solutions. (“Would you like to imagine that. . . ? ”) You can also guide patients to imagine themselves using tools they have learned in therapy: for example, reading a coping card, using controlled breath -ing, and saying self-instructions aloud. Changing the Image Another technique involves teaching patients to reimagine a sponta -neous image, changing the ending to alleviate their distress. The first example is a realistic change, the second, a “magical” change. pa Ti e n T: This morning I was thinking about spring vacation. I can’t go home. I’ll have to stay here. I was feeling really down about that. Th e r a p i s T: Did you have an image of what that would be like? pa Ti e n T: I was imagining myself just sitting at my desk, alone in my room, kind of slumped over, feeling really bad. Th e r a p i s T: Anything else? pa Ti e n T: No, just that it’s so quiet. The dorm is deserted. Th e r a p i s T: And the image makes you feel . . . pa Ti e n T: Sad. Real sad. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, you don’t have to be at the mercy of this image. You can change it, if you want. It’s as if you’re a movie director: You can decide how you want it to be instead. You can change it in a magical way . . . something that couldn’t really happen. Or you can change it to a realistic image. 286 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure I understand how. Th e r a p i s T: Well, okay, you’re sitting at your desk. What do you wish would happen next? pa Ti e n T: That my best friend calls me . . . or it turns out there are more people in the dorm and someone comes knocking on my door, and we go to dinner together. Th e r a p i s T: Any other scenario? pa Ti e n T: Maybe that I remember there’s some event on campus, like a softball game, and I go watch or play. Th e r a p i s T: Those are much better endings. How do you think you’d feel if you imagined those things happening? pa Ti e n T: Better. But how do I know they’ll come true? Th e r a p i s T: Well, first of all, neither of us really knows if you’ll actually end up sitting at your desk, crying. What we do know is imagining it makes you feel really sad now. Second, maybe we could talk about how to make it more likely that there really is a better ending. What could you do so your friend might call, or a dormmate might knock on your door, or you might go to a campus event? Changing the image in this case leads to a productive discussion involv -ing problem solving. Some images lend themselves to change that is more “magical” in nature. Altering the image in this way also usually leads to a reduction in distress and allows the patient to act in a more productive way. An example follows:Th e r a p i s T: [summarizing, using Sally’s own words] So you have an image of your professor standing very tall over you, scowling, speak -ing harshly, stomping his foot, being overbearing, and the image makes you very anxious? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Would you like to change the image? Imagine him in a different way? pa Ti e n T: How? Th e r a p i s T: I don’t know . . . He kind of reminds me of a 3-year-old hav -ing a tantrum. Can you imagine that he shrinks down in size but still is scowling, still stomping his foot? pa Ti e n T: (Smiles . ) Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Describe him to me, in detail. ( Patient does so . ) And how do you feel now? As anxious? Imagery 287 pa Ti e n T: No, less. Th e r a p i s T: Has it come down enough to let you go make an appoint -ment with him? pa Ti e n T: Yes, I think so. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, let’s review what we just did. We started with an image you had of your professor. It sounded as if this image was so dis -tressing that it stopped you from doing what you need to do—make an appointment with him. Then you took control of the image by changing it and your anxiety came down, enough for you to go and meet with him. We call this technique “changing the image. ”Reality Testing the Image Here you teach patients to treat images like verbal automatic thoughts, using standard Socratic questioning. Th e r a p i s T: So you had an image of me frowning and looking disap -proving when you told me you hadn’t done part of your home -work? pa Ti e n T: (Nods . )Th e r a p i s T: What’s the evidence that I would frown and be disapprov -ing? . . . Do you have any evidence on the other side? In another situation, I teach Sally to compare a spontaneous image with what is really happening. pa Ti e n T: I was in the library late last night, and I had an image of the building being real deserted, and then I saw myself suddenly feel -ing really sick and passing out and having no one there to help me. Th e r a p i s T: Was it true that the library was completely deserted? pa Ti e n T: No. It was getting late, near closing time, but there were still a few people around. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. With this kind of image, when you’re spontaneously imagining something happening right at the moment, you can do a reality check. You can ask yourself, “Is the library deserted? Am I actually feeling really sick right now? ” If you had known to do that last night, what do you think would have happened to your mood? pa Ti e n T: I’d have felt less nervous. 288 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND In general, it is preferable to use techniques in imagery form when dealing with images, rather than the verbal techniques suggested in this section. However, patients who have many vivid, distressing images will benefit from a variety of techniques, and sometimes the verbal technique of a reality check is helpful. Repeating the Image The repetition technique can be useful when patients are clearly imag -ining exaggerated outcomes. You suggest that they keep imagining the original image over and over again, paying attention to whether the image and their level of distress change. Some patients seem to do an automatic reality check, and envision each succeeding image more real -istically and with less dysphoria. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, Sally, so you had the image of asking your profes -sor for an extension, and he clearly got quite upset, yelling at you, bending over close to you, waving his hands wildly, saying, “How dare you! You knew when it was due. Get out! ”pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: I wonder, could you imagine this again? Start out the same way. See what happens. pa Ti e n T: (Closes eyes . )Th e r a p i s T: Finished? What happened? pa Ti e n T: He was pretty upset. He yelled at me, told me to get out. Th e r a p i s T: This time did he wave his hands, bend over too close to you? pa Ti e n T: No. He just stood up and stiffened his arms on his desk. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. Do the same thing again. I ask Sally to repeat the scene three or four times. By the last rep -etition, her image has changed quite a bit: The professor leans back in his chair, gives Sally an annoyed look, and says no in an unkind but nonthreatening way. Sally’s anxiety diminishes significantly. Substituting Images Substituting a more pleasant image has been extensively described else -where (e. g. , Beck & Emery, 1985). It, too, must be regularly practiced in order for the patient to experience relief from distressing spontaneous images: Imagery 289 Th e r a p i s T: Sally, another way of dealing with this kind of upsetting image is to substitute a different one. Some people like to imagine that the distressing image is a picture on a television set. Then they imagine changing the channel to a different scene, like lying on a beach, or walking through the woods, or recalling a pleasant mem -ory. Would you like to try this technique? First, you’ll picture the pleasant scene in as much detail as possible, using as many senses as possible; then I’ll have you practice switching from a distressing image to the pleasant one. Now, what pleasant scene would you like to imagine? INDUCING Im AGERY AS A T HERAPEUTIC T OOl At times, you will induce an image as opposed to help a patient respond to a spontaneous image. Covert rehearsal to uncover obstacles related to homework is one example (pages 303–305). Three other induced imaginal techniques are described next. Rehearsal of Coping Techniques You will use this technique to help patients practice using coping strate -gies in imagination. This technique differs from “coping in the image” because here you induce an image rather than having patients imagine how they would cope in a spontaneous image. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, you’re predicting that you’re going to have a rough time giving the oral report in class. pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: When will you first notice your anxiety going up? pa Ti e n T: When I wake up. Th e r a p i s T: And what will be going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I’m going to mess up. And I’ll picture myself stammering and stuttering and being unable to talk. Th e r a p i s T: You mean in class? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, what could you do? pa Ti e n T: Tell myself to relax. Remind myself I’ve practiced this a lot. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, what then? pa Ti e n T: I could do some controlled breathing. That relaxes me some. 290 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Okay, can you see yourself doing that? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: Then what? pa Ti e n T: I feel a little better, but I’m still too nervous for breakfast. I just shower, get dressed, get ready to go. Th e r a p i s T: What’s going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: What if I keep getting more and more nervous? Th e r a p i s T: How about imagining yourself reading the coping card [we made a few minutes ago] on the way to class? Can you imagine pulling it out and reading it? pa Ti e n T: Yeah . . . I guess it helps some. Th e r a p i s T: As you get near class, how about if you imagine jumping ahead in time. You’ve finished the talk, and now you’re sitting there listening to someone else . . . How do you feel now? pa Ti e n T: Some relief. Still worried, but not as bad. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, now you’re walking into class. What happens next, and what do you do? The patient continues imagining herself realistically coping with the situation in detail. Then she writes down the specific techniques she predicts will help. Distancing Distancing is another induced imagery technique to reduce distress and help patients see problems in greater perspective. In the follow -ing example, I help Sally see that her difficulties are likely to be time limited. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, I know you’re feeling kind of hopeless now, and you’re predicting that these problems will go on and on. Do you think it would help if you could envision getting through this rough period? pa Ti e n T: I guess. But it’s hard to imagine. Th e r a p i s T: Well, let’s see. How about if you try to picture yourself a year from now? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: Any idea what life is like? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. It’s hard for me to think that far ahead. Imagery 291 Th e r a p i s T: Well, let’s be concrete. When do you wake up? Where are you? pa Ti e n T: Probably I wake up around 8:00 or 8:30. I guess I’m in an off-campus apartment. Th e r a p i s T: Living alone? pa Ti e n T: Maybe in a house with other students, some people from my floor this year. We’ve been talking about it. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, you wake up. What happens next? pa Ti e n T: I probably rush off to class. It’ll take longer to get there if I’m not in a dorm. Th e r a p i s T: Do you see any of your housemates before you go? Do you go to class alone or with one of them? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. Th e r a p i s T: Well, it’s your image. You decide. pa Ti e n T: Okay, I guess I’d walk over with one of them. Th e r a p i s T: What do you talk about on the way—or are you silent? pa Ti e n T: Oh no, we’d be talking about school or people we know. Something like that. Th e r a p i s T: Then what? pa Ti e n T: I’d go to class. Th e r a p i s T: A big lecture hall like most of your classes this year? pa Ti e n T: No, probably not, classes should be smaller next year. Th e r a p i s T: And what do you want to imagine happens in class? Do you interact or are you quiet? pa Ti e n T: Well, hopefully by then I’d know more people. I’d feel more comfortable. I’d probably still be quiet, but I might be participat -ing more. Th e r a p i s T: How do you feel when you imagine this scene? pa Ti e n T: Good. Th e r a p i s T: How would you feel about finishing out this scene for homework? Then every time you have the thought, “I’ll never get out of this, ” you could try switching to this scene to see if it has an effect on your mood. pa Ti e n T: I’ll try. Th e r a p i s T: Now is this just the power of positive thinking, imagining this scene? Or could you really do some things to make it happen? In fact, aren’t you already doing things to make it happen? pa Ti e n T: That’s true. 292 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Another distancing technique helps a patient deal with the imag -ined aftermath of a catastrophe. Marie, described previously, fears that her children would be devastated forever if she died. Her therapist has her imagine their realistic level of distress at different points in time, instead of just immediately after the accident. (This technique is simi -lar to jumping ahead in time; it involves the passage of years, though, instead of minutes, hours, or days. )Th e r a p i s T: Marie, who do you imagine breaks the news of your death to the kids? pa Ti e n T: My husband. Th e r a p i s T: How does he do it? pa Ti e n T: (sobbing ) He puts his arms around them. He says, “There’s been an accident. Mommy’s gone. ”Th e r a p i s T: And then? pa Ti e n T: They don’t believe it, not really, at first. They start crying and saying, “No, it’s not true. I want Mommy. ”Th e r a p i s T: They’re feeling pretty bad? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Real bad. Th e r a p i s T: (Waits a moment . ) Can you jump ahead some? It’s now 6 months later. What’s going on now? Can you see them? pa Ti e n T: They’re in school. Looking real sad. Bewildered. Kind of empty. Th e r a p i s T: How bad are they feeling? pa Ti e n T: Still pretty bad. Th e r a p i s T: Can we jump ahead 2 years? How old will they be? pa Ti e n T: Melissa will be 8. Linda will be 7. Th e r a p i s T: What do you see them doing? pa Ti e n T: Playing outside. It’s our house. I don’t think my husband would move. Th e r a p i s T: What are they playing? pa Ti e n T: They’re jumping rope with the neighbor kids. Th e r a p i s T: How are they feeling now? pa Ti e n T: Okay, when they don’t think about me. Th e r a p i s T: And when they do? pa Ti e n T: (Tears up . ) They still cry sometimes. It’s confusing. Th e r a p i s T: As bad as when they first found out? pa Ti e n T: No, not that bad. Imagery 293 The therapist gently leads Marie through a succession of images 5, 10, and 20 years after her imagined death. Through this exercise, Marie is able to see that the initial devastation her daughters feel eventually subsides to briefer periods of sadness and grief with which they are able to cope. Imagining in detail that her daughters grow up and create new families of their own significantly reduces Marie’s fear of her own death in an automobile accident. Reduction of Perceived Threat A third type of induced image is designed to allow patients to view a situation with a more realistic assessment of actual threat. For example, I encouraged Sally to modify her image of her class presentation by imagining the encouraging faces of her friends in the room. Pam, a patient who feared undergoing a Caesarean section, envisioned all the life-saving equipment in the delivery room and the caring faces of the nurse and doctor behind their masks. In summary, many if not most patients experience automatic thoughts in the form of spontaneous images. Persistent (though nonin -trusive) questioning is often required to help patients recognize their images. Patients who do have frequent, distressing images benefit from regular practice of several imagery techniques. In addition, images may be induced for various therapeutic purposes. 294 Chapter 17 HOm EWORk Homework is an integral, not optional, part of cognitive behavior therapy (Beck et al. , 1979). A number of researchers have found that cognitive behavior therapy patients who carry out homework assign-ments progress better in therapy than those who do not (e. g. , Kazantzis, Whittington, & Datillio, 2010; Neimeyer & Feixas, 1990; Persons, Burns & Perloff, 1988). You seek to extend the opportunities for cognitive and behavioral change throughout the patient’s week . You prepare the patient for doing homework in the fi rst session. Th e r a p i s T : Sally, I think it would be important for you to read this [statement about being depressed, not lazy] every day. Do you think you could do that? pa T i e n T : Yes, I think so. Th e r a p i s T : In fact, reminding yourself of important things we talk about in session is one way you’re going to get over your depres-sion. Another way is by changing some of the things that you do. We’ve found that it’s not enough for people to just come and talk. They need to make small changes in their thinking and behavior every day. pa T i e n T : Okay. Th e r a p i s T : But we’ll always make sure that you think the changes are a good idea and that you’ll be able to do them. Now, what should we call these changes? Homework? Your action plan? Something else? Homework 295 pa Ti e n T: Homework, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, but I want you to remember that this isn’t like school homework. This is homework that you think will help, that we’ll design together, just for you. Good homework assignments provide opportunities for patients to educate themselves further (e. g. , through bibliotherapy), to collect data (e. g. , through monitoring their thoughts, feelings, and behavior), to test their thoughts and beliefs, to modify their thinking, to practice cognitive and behavioral tools, and to experiment with new behaviors. Homework can maximize what was learned in a therapy session and lead to an increase in patients’ sense of self-efficacy. Many patients do homework quite willingly and easily; a few do not. It is important to note that even the most experienced therapists encounter difficulty with an occasional patient who, despite careful preparation, rarely does any written assignments. Nevertheless, you should initially assume that any patient (unless he or she is very low functioning) will do homework if you set it up properly. To enhance the probability that patients will comply, you need to take care, for exam -ple, to:Tailor assignments to the individual, • Provide a sound rationale, • Uncover potential obstacles, and• modify relevant beliefs. • This chapter is divided into four parts:1. Setting homework assignments. 2. Increasing the likelihood of successful completion of home -work. 3. Conceptualizing problems. 4. Reviewing completed homework. SETTING H Om EWOR k ASSIGN m ENTSThere is no set formula for assigning homework. Rather, you tailor homework to the individual patient. How do you decide what to sug -gest? It depends on what you have discussed in session, which is influ -enced by your overall treatment plan and the patient’s goals. You take 296 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND into consideration individual characteristics of patients: their reading and writing abilities, their motivation and willingness to comply with homework, their current level of distress and functioning (cognitive, emotional, and behavioral), and practical constraints (e. g. , of time), to name a few. You may need to take the lead in suggesting homework assignments at the beginning of treatment but you begin, as soon as possible, to ask patients to devise their own assignments (e. g. , “Now that we’ve finished talking about this problem with your roommate, what do you think would be helpful for you to remember this week? To do this week? ”). Patients who routinely set their own homework by the end of therapy are more likely to continue doing so when treatment has ended. In this first section, typical assignments are presented; then a sam -ple of Sally’s homework assignments are provided. The final portion of this chapter offers guidelines for increasing homework adherence. Ongoing Homework Assignments Typical ongoing homework assignments are discussed below. 1. Behavioral activation . Getting inactive, depressed patients out of bed or off the couch and helping them resume their normal activities (and engage in new activities) is essential. Activity scheduling benefits other patients as well. 2. Monitoring automatic thoughts . From the first session forward, you will encourage your patients to ask themselves, “What’s going through my mind right now? ” when they notice their mood changing, and remind themselves that their thinking may or may not be true. Initially they may jot down their thoughts (in their smartphone, on their com -puter, or simply on paper, in a notebook, or on an index card). Advise patients that monitoring their automatic thoughts can lead them to feel worse, if they accept them uncritically, and that you will do problem solving with them if their thoughts do turn out to be valid. 3. Evaluating and responding to automatic thoughts . At virtually every session, you will help patients modify their inaccurate and dysfunc -tional thoughts and write down their new way of thinking. An essential homework assignment is to have them read these therapy notes on a regular basis. Patients will also learn to evaluate their own thinking and practice doing so between sessions. 4. Problem solving . At virtually every session, you will help patients devise solutions to their problems, which they will implement between sessions. 5. Behavioral skills . To effectively solve their problems, patients may need to learn new skills, which they will practice for homework. For Homework 297 example, you might teach relaxation skills to anxious patients, asser -tiveness skills to socially anxious patients, or organizational and time management skills to patients who would benefit from them. 6. Behavioral experiments . Patients may need to directly test the valid -ity of automatic thoughts that seem distorted, such as “I’ll feel better if I stay in bed”; “My roommate will get mad if I bring up the problem of noise”; “No one will talk to me at the meeting. ”7. Bibliotherapy . Important concepts you are discussing in session can be greatly reinforced when patients read about them in black and white. It is usually valuable to have patients both read and note their reactions: what they agreed with, disagreed with, and had questions about. 8. Preparing for the next therapy session . The beginning part of each therapy session can be greatly speeded up if patients think about what is important to tell you before they enter your office. The Preparing for Therapy Worksheet (page 102) can help prepare them. A Sampling of Homework Assignments for Sally Some of the assignments below are helpful for almost any depressed patient; others were specifically designed for this particular patient. Session 1 Read this list twice a day; set an alarm to remember. 1. If I start thinking I’m lazy and no good, remind myself that I have a real illness, called depression, that makes it harder for me to do things. As the treatment starts to work, my depression will lift, and things will get easier. 2. Read goal list and add others, if I think of any. 3. When I notice my mood getting worse, ask myself, “What’s going through my mind right now? ” and jot down the thoughts. Remind myself that just because I think something doesn’t necessarily mean it’s true. 4. Make plans with Allison and Joe. Remember, if they say no, it’s likely that they’d like to hang out with me but they’re too busy. 5. Read Coping with Depression booklet (optional). Session 21. Daily: When I notice my mood changing, ask myself, “What’s going through my mind right now? ” and jot down my automatic thoughts (which may or may not be completely true). 2. If I can’t figure out my automatic thoughts, jot down just the situa - 298 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND tion. Remember, learning to identify my thinking is a skill I’ll get better at, like typing. 3. Ask Sean for help with Chapter 5 of Econ book. 4. Daily: Read therapy notes. 5. Continue running/swimming. 6. Plan two to three social activities. 7. Daily: Add to credit list (anything I do that is even a little difficult but I do it anyway). 8. (Tuesday morning): Review Preparing for Therapy Worksheet for 2 minutes. Session 31. Daily: Read therapy notes. 2. Daily: When my mood changes, use Question List and answer men -tally or in writing. 3. Daily: Add to credit list. 4. Daily: Follow activity chart. 5. Ask Lisa to study for Chem exam with me. 6. (Tuesday morning): Review Preparing for Therapy Worksheet. Session 41. Daily: Read therapy notes. 2. Daily: When my mood changes, do first four columns of Thought Records in writing. Answer questions at bottom mentally. 3. Daily: Credit list. 4. Go for a walk or a run at least three days this week. 5. Make plans with friends. 6. Do activities we scheduled on activity chart. 7. Discuss late-night noise with Jane. 8. (Tuesday morning): Review Preparing for Therapy Worksheet. Session 51. Daily: Read therapy notes. 2. Daily: Thought Records mentally or in writing. 3. Daily: Credit list. 4. Daily: Follow activity chart. 5. Ask Chem professor for help. Session 61. Daily: Read therapy notes. 2. As needed: Thought Records. 3. Daily: Credit list. Homework 2994. Schedule activities. 5. Call Mom about summer plans. Session 71. Daily: Read therapy notes. 2. As needed: Thought Records. 3. Daily: Credit list. 4. Schedule activities. 5. Make a comment or ask a question in class. Session 91. Daily: Therapy notes. 2. As needed: Thought Records. 3. Daily: Credit list. 4. Schedule activities. 5. Fill in CBW. 6. Bring up clutter problem with Jane. 7. Go to Dr. Smith during office hours. Session 12 (Penultimate Session)1. Thought Record about termination. 2. Organize therapy notes from beginning. 3. Review notes on doing a self-therapy session. Increas Ing Homework a d Herence Although some patients easily do the suggested assignments, home-work is more problematic for others. Implementation of the following guidelines increases the likelihood that patients will be successful with homework and experience an elevation in mood:1. Tailor the assignment to the individual. (Be 90–100% sure the patient can and will do the assignment. ) e rr on the side of devising assignments that are too easy rather than too hard. 2. Provide a rationale as to how and why the assignment might help. 3. set homework collaboratively; seek the patient’s input and agreement. 4. make homework a no-lose proposition. 5. Begin the assignment (when possible) in session. 6. Help set up systems for remembering to do the assignment. 300 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND 7. Anticipate possible problems; do covert rehearsal when indicated. 8. Prepare for a possible negative outcome (when applicable). Tailoring Homework to the Individual Successful completion of homework can speed up therapy and lead to an increased sense of mastery and improved mood. Rather than sug -gesting assignments according to a prescribed formula, you should consider the patient’s characteristics (mentioned in the introduction to this chapter) and desires. Matt, for example, was a patient who did not grasp the cognitive model in the first session and, indeed, became slightly irritated when his (novice) therapist kept pushing him to identify his automatic thoughts. He told his therapist, “You don’t understand; I don’t know what is going through my mind at the time; all I know is that I’m very upset. ” A home -work assignment to jot down his automatic thoughts would have been inappropriate for this session. A second patient, Caitlin, on the other hand, had already read a popular book on cognitive behavior therapy and had an unusually good grasp of her automatic thoughts. Her initial homework assignment was to complete the first four columns of the Thought Record whenever she became upset. While the type of assignment is important, so is the amount of homework. Sally was a motivated patient who was “in sync” with home -work, as she was still a student. She was easily able to accomplish more between sessions than Matt, who was severely depressed and had been out of school for many years. A third step in tailoring homework to the individual patient involves breaking down assignments into manageable steps. Examples include reading one chapter of a layman’s cognitive behavior therapy book or school textbook, doing the first four columns of a Thought Record, spending 10–15 minutes paying bills, doing just one load of laundry, and spending just five minutes at a supermarket. It is important to predict potential difficulties before assigning homework. Patients’ diagnoses and personality styles can be a guide. Severely depressed patients, for example, initially will probably ben -efit more from behavioral (as opposed to cognitive) tasks. Avoidant patients shy away from behavioral assignments that they perceive as too challenging or likely to evoke a high level of dysphoria. Patients who are feeling anxious and overwhelmed might feel incapable of doing any assignment if you suggest too many tasks. It is much better to err on the side of providing homework assignments that are a little too easy. Fail -ure to carry out an assignment, or to do it properly, often leads a patient to be self-critical or feel hopeless. Homework 301 Providing a Rationale Patients are more likely to comply with homework assignments if they understand the reason for doing them. I introduce a homework assign -ment to Sally in this way:Th e r a p i s T: Sally, research shows that exercise often helps people become less depressed. What do you think about taking a walk or a run a few times this week? You will provide a brief rationale initially; later in treatment, you will encourage patients to think about the purpose of an assignment, for example, “Sally, what would be the point of checking with your roommate about her plans for this weekend? ” or “Why might it be a good idea to continue keeping the credit list? ” It is also important to emphasize that homework is an essential part of treatment:Th e r a p i s T: The way people get better is to make small changes in their thinking and behavior every day. Setting Homework Collaboratively Ideally, patients would set their own homework, but at the beginning of treatment they do not know which assignments would be beneficial. Instead, you will make suggestions and ensure they agree: “What do you think about asking your boss for time off? ”; “Do you think it could help if you read this coping card before you leave the house? ”; “Do you want to try [a particular technique] this week? ”; “I think if you get in the shower as soon as you get up, you’ll demonstrate to yourself that you can take control. What do you think? Is this something you want to try? ” If patients are hesitant or skeptical, you will need to prepare them further. Either elicit and help them respond to their automatic thoughts and/or make the assignment much easier. As therapy progresses, you will encourage patients to set their own assignments. “What would you like to do this week about [this prob -lem]? ”; “What could you do this week if you start getting uncomfortably anxious? ”; “How will you handle [this problem] if it does arise? ”Making Homework a No-Lose Proposition It is helpful when initially setting up assignments to stress that useful data can be obtained even if patients fail to complete their homework. Patients who do not do the homework are less likely to brand them -selves as failures and thus feel more dysphoric: 302 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Sally, if you get this homework done, that’s good. But if you have trouble doing it, that’s okay—just see if you can figure out what thoughts are getting in your way, and we’ll talk about those thoughts next time. Okay? Sometimes patients fail to do a significant portion of their home -work for two weeks in a row, or they do it immediately before the ther -apy session instead of daily. In these cases, you should uncover the psychological and/or practical obstacles that got in the way and stress how essential homework is, instead of continuing to make it a no-lose proposition. Starting Homework in the Session If you can, have patients begin assignments right in the therapy session itself; they will be far more likely to follow through at home. Continuing an assignment is much easier than initiating one. This is especially criti -cal because patients often describe the hardest part of doing homework as the period just before they initiate it—that is, motivating themselves to get started. If you yourself find that you, too, occasionally have difficulty initiating a task (e. g. , getting yourself to work on a paper, pay taxes, or start exercising), but find it much easier after a few minutes, you can self-disclose this to patients to normalize the experience and provide a role model for them to think about when they are procrastinating. Remembering to Do Homework It is vital to write down, or have patients write down, their assignments every week, starting with the first session. Ask them where they will keep the assignment list (or notebook) and how likely they think they might be to forget to look at the list on one or more days. If even slightly likely, you might suggest several strategies: You can ask patients to:Pair an assignment with another daily activity (e. g. , “How about • pulling out the activity chart at mealtimes and right before bed? ”). Post notes on their refrigerator, their bathroom mirror, or the • dashboard of their car. Use their appointment book, smartphone, or computer to cue • them. Ask another person to cue them. • You can also ask them how they remember to do other regularly sched -uled activities, such as taking medication. Homework 303 Anticipating Problems To maximize the likelihood that you are suggesting reasonable assign -ments that patients are likely to do, consider the following:Is the amount and degree of difficulty of homework • reasonable for this patient, or will it feel overwhelming? Is it related to the patient’s goals? • How likely is the patient to do it? • What practical problems may get in the way (time, • energy, opportunity)? What thoughts may get in the way? • The single most important question to ask patients to assess the probability of adherence is:How likely are you to do this, 0–100%? If patients are less than 90–100% confident, use one or more of the following strategies:1. Covert rehearsal. 2. Change the assignment. 3. Do an intellectual/emotional role play. These stategies are described below. Covert Rehearsal Covert rehearsal, illustrated below, uses induced imagery to uncover and solve potential homework-related problems. Th e r a p i s T: Sally, do you think anything will get in the way of your going to the teaching assistant for help? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: [getting her to specify and commit to a time] When would be a good time to go? pa Ti e n T: Friday morning, I guess. That’s when his office hours are. 304 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Can you imagine it’s Friday morning right now? Can you picture it? Can you imagine saying to yourself, “I really should go to the TA’s office”? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: [asking for details so Sally will more easily be able to visu -alize the scene and accurately identify her thoughts and emotions] Where are you? pa Ti e n T: In my room. Th e r a p i s T: Doing what? pa Ti e n T: Well, I just finished getting dressed. Th e r a p i s T: And how are you feeling? pa Ti e n T: A little nervous, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: And what’s going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I don’t want to go. Maybe I’ll just read the chapter again myself. Th e r a p i s T: And how are you going to answer those thoughts? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. Th e r a p i s T: Do you want to remind yourself it’s just an experiment, that we won’t know what happens until you go? That if he’s not helpful, we’ll figure out Plan B together? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, I think so. Th e r a p i s T: Would it help to put that on a coping card you can read a few times between now and Friday? pa Ti e n T: Probably. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. Now can you imagine you’re dressed and you’re thinking, “I’ll just read the chapter myself instead of going”? Now what happens? pa Ti e n T: I think, “Wait a minute. This is supposed to be an experi -ment. Now where’s that coping card? ”Th e r a p i s T: Oh, where is it? pa Ti e n T: Knowing me, I’d have to look for it. Th e r a p i s T: Is there someplace you could put it as soon as you get back today? pa Ti e n T: I don’t exactly want my roommate to see it . . . Maybe in the bottom drawer of my desk. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. And if you’ve already read it on Wednesday and Thursday, you’ll probably remember where it is. Can you imagine pulling out the card and reading it? Homework 305 pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: Now, what happens? pa Ti e n T: Probably I remember why I should go, but I still don’t want to. So I decide to clean my room first. Th e r a p i s T: What could you remind yourself at this point? pa Ti e n T: That I may as well go and get it over with. That maybe it really will help. That if I stop and clean I may end up not going at all. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Then what happens? pa Ti e n T: I go. Th e r a p i s T: And then? pa Ti e n T: I get there. I ask him the question. I don’t understand it all. I tell him what I’m confused about. He probably helps, at least some. Th e r a p i s T: And how do you feel at this point? pa Ti e n T: Better. This kind of covert rehearsal helps you discover which practical obstacles and dysfunctional cognitions may hinder the completion of homework. Changing the Assignment Changing the assignment may be indicated if you judge that an assign -ment is inappropriate or if covert rehearsal has not been sufficiently effective. It is far better to substitute an easier homework assignment that patients are likely to do than to have them establish a habit of not doing what they had agreed to in session:Th e r a p i s T: Sally, I’m not sure you’re ready to do this. [Or, “I’m not sure this assignment is appropriate. ”] What do you think? Do you want to go ahead and try or wait until another time? You can also collaboratively decide to make certain assignments optional or to decrease the frequency or duration of a homework task. It is far better for patients to do less homework than no homework at all. Intellectual–Emotional Role Play An intellectual–emotional role play may help motivate reluctant patients when the therapist judges it is quite important for a patient to 306 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND do a given assignment. This technique is not used early in therapy, as it can be perceived as somewhat challenging. Th e r a p i s T: I’m still not sure you’ll actually pull out the coping card to get you going. pa Ti e n T: Probably not. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, how about if we do an intellectual–emotional role play about this? We’ve done this before. I’ll be the intellectual part of you; you be the emotional part. You argue as hard as you can against me so I can see all the arguments you’re using not to read your coping cards and start studying. You start. pa Ti e n T: Okay. I don’t feel like doing this. Th e r a p i s T: It’s true that I don’t feel like doing it, but that’s irrelevant. It doesn’t matter if I feel like it or not. It’s what I need to do. pa Ti e n T: But I can do it later. Th e r a p i s T: True, but my usual pattern is not to do it later. I don’t want to reinforce a bad habit by putting it off. Here I have the opportu -nity to strengthen a new, better habit. pa Ti e n T: But it won’t matter this one time. Th e r a p i s T: True. Any one individual time isn’t all that crucial. On the other hand, I’ll be better off in the long run if I strengthen this good habit as much as I can. pa Ti e n T: I don’t know, I just don’t want to. Th e r a p i s T: I don’t have to pay attention to what I want to do now or don’t want to do now. In the long run, I want to do things that I need to, so I can graduate, get a good job, and feel good about myself, and I don’t want to constantly avoid things I don’t feel like doing. pa Ti e n T: . . . I’ve run out of arguments. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. Let’s switch parts, then we’ll get some of it down in writing. Following role reversal, you have another choice point. You can col -laboratively reassign the original homework task (e. g. , “How do you feel now about trying [this assignment]? ”). If patients do decide to keep the assignment, you and they can jointly write a coping card with some points mentioned in the role play above. If you believe it is unlikely that the patient will fulfill the assignment, however, you should suggest a change in homework or make the assignment optional. Homework 307 Preparing for a Possible Negative Outcome When devising a behavioral experiment or testing an assumption, it is important to set up a scenario that is likely to succeed. For example, Sally and I discussed which professor was most likely to be receptive to ques -tions after class, what words she might use when negotiating late-night noise with her roommate, and how much help was reasonable to ask from her friend. It is a good idea, though, to have patients predict likely auto -matic thoughts or beliefs if the experiment does not turn out well. Th e r a p i s T: Now I suppose it could happen that Ross says he can’t help you. If that happens, what will go through your mind? pa Ti e n T: That I shouldn’t have asked. That he probably thinks I’m stu -pid for asking. Th e r a p i s T: [seeking an alternative explanation] What other reasons might he have for saying no? pa Ti e n T: That he was too busy. Th e r a p i s T: Or is it possible that he doesn’t understand the material well enough to explain it to you? Or, that he simply doesn’t like tutoring? Or, that he’s preoccupied with something else? pa Ti e n T: I guess so. Th e r a p i s T: Do you have any evidence so far that he thinks you’re stu -pid? pa Ti e n T: No, but we did disagree about politics. Th e r a p i s T: And did you get the idea that he thought your ideas were definitely stupid or that you simply had another point of view? pa Ti e n T: That we just felt differently about it. Th e r a p i s T: So as far as you know, he doesn’t view you as stupid? pa Ti e n T: No, I don’t think so. Th e r a p i s T: So even if he turns you down, it won’t necessarily be that he’s changed his view of you, based on your request for help? pa Ti e n T: No, I guess not. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, we’ve agreed that you’ll approach him later today and ask for help. Either he’ll help you, and that’s good, or he’ll say no, and then what will you remind yourself? pa Ti e n T: That it doesn’t mean he thinks I’m stupid. He may just be busy or unsure of the stuff himself or not like to tutor people. Th e r a p i s T: Good, let’s write that down, just in case. 308 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Advance discussion of potential problems guards against dysphoria when an experiment does not turn out well. CONCEPTUA l Iz ING D Iff ICUl TIESWhen patients have difficulty doing their homework, conceptualize why the problem arose. Was it related to:A practical problem? • A psychological problem? • A psychological problem masked as a practical problem? • A problem related to the • therapist’s cognitions? Practical Problems Most practical problems can be avoided if you carefully set the assign -ment and prepare the patient to do it. Covert rehearsal (described ear -lier) can also ferret out potential difficulties. Four common practical problems and their remedies are described next. Doing Therapy Homework at the Last Minute Ideally, patients carry on the work of the therapy session throughout the week. For example, it is most useful for patients to catch and record their automatic thoughts at the moment they notice their mood chang -ing and to respond to these thoughts either mentally or in writing. Some patients avoid thinking about therapy between sessions. Often, this avoidance is part of a larger problem, and you may first have to help patients identify and modify certain beliefs (e. g. , “If I focus on a problem instead of distracting myself, I’ll only feel worse” or “I can’t change, so why even try? ”). Other patients, however, need only a gentle reminder to look at their homework list daily. Forgetting the Rationale for an Assignment Occasionally, patients neglect an assignment because they do not remember why they were asked to do it. This problem can be avoided by having patients (who have demonstrated this difficulty) record the rationale next to an assignment. Homework 309 pa Ti e n T: I didn’t do the relaxation exercises [or read the coping cards or practice controlled breathing or record my activities] because I was feeling fine this week. Th e r a p i s T: Do you remember what we said a few weeks ago—why it’s helpful to practice this every day, regardless of how you’re feeling? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: Well, let’s say you don’t practice your relaxation exercises for a couple of weeks. Then you have a very stressful week. How sharp will your skills be then? pa Ti e n T: Not very. Th e r a p i s T: Could we have you write down relaxation exercises for homework again this week with a reminder that you want to be really good at relaxation before you need to use it? ( pause ) Any other problems with practicing it? Disorganization or Lack of Accountability Many patients are more likely to do assignments when they have to mark off a daily checklist indicating whether they fulfilled an assign -ment. You or patients can draw a simple diagram (Figure 17. 1) in ses -sion. Instruct patients to check off each assignment they complete each day. This technique both helps patients remember to do assignments and also makes them face what they are not doing. Alternately, patients can write down assignments on a daily calen -dar or appointment book. (Do the first day together in the office and ask patients to write down the rest in the reception room after the ses -sion. ) Later, after completing assignments, patients can check or cross them off. A third technique, which you might use with patients whose adher -ence is likely to be low, is suggesting that they call your office to leave a message when they have completed an assignment. Knowing that you expect a message may motivate patients to do the homework. W Th f Sat Sun m T 1. Read therapy notes 2. Do a credit list 3. Do a Thought Record 4. Ask a question in class FIGURE 17. 1. Sample daily checklist for homework assignments. 310 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND As with any intervention, you should suggest these possibilities with a rationale and be sure that patients agree. Difficulty with an Assignment If you realize at a subsequent session that a homework assignment was too difficult or ill-defined (common problems with novice therapists), take responsibility. Otherwise patients may unfairly criticize themselves for not having successfully completed an assignment:Th e r a p i s T: Sally, now that we’ve talked about the problem you had with the homework, I can see that I didn’t explain it well enough to you. [Or, “I can see that it was really too hard. ”] I’m sorry about that. What went through your mind when you couldn’t [or didn’t] do it? Here you have an opportunity to (1) model that you can make and admit to mistakes, (2) build rapport, (3) demonstrate that you are con-cerned with tailoring therapy—and homework assignments—to the patient, and (4) help patients see an alternative explanation for their lack of success. Psychological Problems If patients don’t do an assignment that was properly set up and which they had the opportunity to do, their difficulty may stem from one of the psychological factors described next. Negative Predictions When patients are in psychological distress, and particularly when they are depressed, they tend to assume negative outcomes. To identify dys-functional cognitions that interfered with doing a homework assign-ment, ask patients to recall a specific time they thought about doing the assignment and then elicit related cognitions and feelings:Th e r a p i s T: Was there a time this week when you did think about read -ing the booklet on depression? pa Ti e n T: Yes. I thought about it on and off. Th e r a p i s T: Tell me about one of these times. Did you think about it last night, for example? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. I was going to do it after dinner. Th e r a p i s T: What happened? Homework 311 pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. I just couldn’t make myself do it. Th e r a p i s T: How were you feeling? pa Ti e n T: Down, sad, kind of tired. Th e r a p i s T: What was going through your mind as you thought about reading the booklet? pa Ti e n T: This is hard. I probably won’t be able to concentrate. I won’t understand it. Th e r a p i s T: Sounds like you were feeling pretty low. No wonder you were having trouble getting started. In fact, maybe we should have had you start reading it right in our session last week. ( pause ) I wonder how we could test this idea that you won’t be able to con -centrate and understand it. pa Ti e n T: I guess I could try it. You might then ask patients to conduct an experiment right in session. Following a successful outcome, they might write down conclusions such as: “Sometimes my thoughts aren’t true and I can do more than I think. Next time I feel hopeless, I can do an experiment, like I did with the booklet. ” (Note: If the experiment were unsuccessful, you would need to change the assignment to a more basic task. )Patients can test other negative predictions (such as, “My room -mate won’t want to go to that meeting with me, ” or “I won’t understand the material even if I ask for help, ” or “Doing homework will make me feel worse”) through behavioral experiments. Again, it is important to prepare patients for their reaction to a possible negative outcome. You can help patients evaluate other thoughts, such as, “I can’t do anything right, ” or “I might fail this course, ” with standard Socratic question -ing. When patients reveal ambivalence about the usefulness of doing an assignment, you should acknowledge that you do not know what the outcome will be: “I don’t know for sure that doing this assignment will help. What will you lose if it doesn’t work? What’s the potential gain in the long run if it does work? ” Alternatively, you and the patient could list advantages and disadvantages of doing the homework. Finally, a patient may benefit from work at the belief level. Home -work may activate beliefs such as:“I’m incompetent. ”“Having to do therapy homework means I’m defective. ”“I shouldn’t have to put forth so much effort to feel better. ”“my therapist is trying to control me. ” 312 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND “If I think about my problems, I’ll feel worse and worse. ”“If I do homework and get better, my life will get worse. ”These kinds of beliefs can be identified and modified through techniques described in Chapters 13 and 14. Overestimating the Demands of an Assignment Some patients overestimate how inconvenient or difficult it will be to do homework or do not realize that doing a therapy assignment will be time limited. Th e r a p i s T: What could get in the way of your doing a Thought Record a few times this week? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure I’ll find the time. Th e r a p i s T: How long do you think it will take each time? pa Ti e n T: Not that long. Maybe 10 minutes. But I’m pretty rushed these days, you know. I do have a million things to do. You can then do straightforward problem solving to find possible time slots. Alternatively, you might propose an analogy, stressing that the inconvenience of doing assignments is time limited:Th e r a p i s T: It certainly is true; you are very busy these days. I wonder—this is an extreme example, I know—but what would you do if you had to take time every day to do something that would save your life [or your loved one’s life]? What would happen, for example, if you needed a blood transfusion every day? pa Ti e n T: Well, of course I’d find the time. Th e r a p i s T: Now, it’s obviously not life threatening if you don’t do this assignment, but the principle is the same. In a minute, we can talk specifically about how you could cut back in another area, but first it’s important to remember that this is not for the rest of your life. We just need you to rearrange some things for a little while until you’re feeling better. The patient who overestimates the energy an assignment benefits from similar questions. In the next example, the patient has a dysfunc -tional (and distorted) image of fulfilling an assignment. Th e r a p i s T: What could get in the way of your going to the mall every day this week? pa Ti e n T: (Sighs . ) I don’t know if I’ll have the energy. Homework 313 Th e r a p i s T: What are you envisioning? pa Ti e n T: Well, I can see dragging myself into one store after another. Th e r a p i s T: You know, we talked about your going just for 10 minutes every day. How many stores would you actually get to in 10 minutes? I wonder if you could be imagining that this assignment will be more difficult than we had planned? In a different situation, the patient has correctly recalled the assign -ment but again overestimates the energy it will require. I first help specify the problem by doing a modified, short version of covert rehearsal. pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure I’ll have the energy to take Max to the park for 15 minutes. Th e r a p i s T: Will the problem be mostly getting out of the house, going to the park, or what you’ll have to do at the park? pa Ti e n T: Getting out of the house. I have to get so much stuff together—his diaper bag, the stroller, a bottle, his coat and boots . . . [The therapist and patient then problem-solve; one solution is for her to gather all the necessities earlier in the day when she is feeling more energetic and less overwhelmed. ]In a third situation, I simply set up the assignment as an experi -ment. pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure I’ll have the energy to make the phone calls. Th e r a p i s T: Since we’ve run short of time today, how about if we just set up this assignment as an experiment: Let’s write down your predic -tion—“I won’t have enough energy to make the calls”—and next session, you can tell me how accurate it was. Is that okay? Perfectionism Many patients benefit from a simple reminder that they should not strive for perfection when doing homework:Th e r a p i s T: Learning to identify your automatic thoughts is a skill, like learning the computer. You’ll get better with practice. So, if you have any trouble this week, don’t worry. We’ll figure out how to do it better at our next session. Other patients with a strong underlying assumption about the necessity of being perfect may benefit from assignments that include mistakes: 314 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: It sounds as if your belief about perfectionism is showing up in difficulty doing therapy homework. pa Ti e n T: Yeah, it is. Th e r a p i s T: How about this week if we have you do a Thought Record that is deliberately imperfect? You could do it with messy handwrit -ing or not do it thoroughly or make spelling mistakes. We should also put a 10-minute time limit on it. Psychological Obstacles Masked as Practical Problems Some patients propose that practical problems such as lack of time, energy, or opportunity may prevent them from carrying out an assign -ment. If you believe that a thought or belief is also interfering, you should investigate this possibility before discussing the practical problem:Th e r a p i s T: Okay, so you’re not sure you’ll be able to do this assign -ment [because of a practical problem]. Let’s pretend for a moment that this problem magically disappears. Now how likely are you do to the homework? Would anything else interfere? Any thoughts that would get in the way? Problems Related to the Therapist’s Cognitions Finally, you should assess whether any of your thoughts or beliefs hin -der you from assertively and appropriately encouraging a patient to do homework. Typical dysfunctional assumptions of therapists include:“I’ll hurt his feelings if I try to find out why he didn’t do the homework. ”“She’ll get angry if I [nicely] question her. ”“He’ll be insulted if I suggest he try a homework monitor. ”“She doesn’t really need to do homework to get better. ”“He is too overburdened now with other things. ”“She’s too passive–aggressive to do homework. ”“He’s too fragile to expose himself to an anxious situation. ”Ask yourself what goes through your mind when you think about assigning homework or exploring why a patient has not done home -work. If you are having dysfunctional thoughts, you might do Thought Records or behavioral experiments or consult a supervisor or peer. Remind yourself that you are not doing patients a favor if you allow Homework 315 them to skip homework (which research shows is important) and do not make extensive efforts to gain adherence. REVIEWING H Om EWOR k Before each session, you should prepare by reviewing the notes of the previous session and noting the patient’s homework. A discussion of homework is typically the first item on the agenda, unless it is clearly inappropriate (e. g. , the patient is grieving a recent, serious loss). Even if a patient is in crisis, it is still useful to spend a few minutes discuss -ing homework later in the session or, in a different case, to collabora -tively agree that the homework assigned at the previous session does not apply at the moment. Deciding how much time to spend reviewing homework and dis -cussing whether patients want to continue any assignment is part of the art of therapy. You will spend more time on homework when:It covers an important, ongoing problem that requires further • discussion. Patients have not completed a task. • You judge that it is important to discuss what patients have learned • or to help them reach a new understanding of their problems. For example, if severely depressed patients do not follow through with activity scheduling, you will likely spend significant time in session con -ceptualizing what happened and planning with them how they can be more successful in the coming week. Spending too little time reviewing homework may deprive patients of reinforcing important learning and skills. Spending too much time may deprive patients of discussing new problems thoroughly. The time you devote to a review of homework will vary. At the beginning of treatment, you will reinforce what was in the therapy notes (e. g. , asking patients how much they believe the adaptive responses they wrote in the past session(s) and at home). You may need to review and allow patients to practice skills they did not quite grasp. You will also collaboratively decide which assignments a patient will continue or modify for the coming week. In summary, both you and your patients should view homework as an essential part of treatment. Homework, properly assigned and com -pleted, speeds progress and allows patients to practice the techniques of therapy which they will need when therapy is over. Kazantzis, Deane, Ronan, and Lampropoulos (2005) and Tompkins (2004) are helpful resources. 316 Chapter 18 TERm INATION AND REl APSE PREVENTIONThe goal in cognitive behavior therapy is to facilitate remission of patients’ disorders and to teach them skills they can use throughout their lifetime. The goal is not for you to solve all their problems. In fact, if you view yourself as responsible for helping patients with every prob-lem, you risk engendering or reinforcing dependence and you deprive patients of the opportunity to test and strengthen their skills. Therapy sessions are usually scheduled once a week, unless there are practical constraints. Patients with severe symptoms may benefi t from more frequent sessions. Once patients have experienced a reduc-tion in symptoms and have learned basic skills, you may collaboratively agree to taper therapy gradually, on a trial basis, to once every 2 weeks and then to once every 3 to 4 weeks. In addition, patients are encour-aged to schedule “booster” sessions approximately 3, 6, and 12 months after termination. This chapter outlines steps to prepare patients for termination and possible relapse from the start of therapy to the fi nal booster session. EARl Y ACTIVITIESYou will begin to prepare patients for termination and relapse even in the initial session, as you tell them that your goal is to make treatment as time limited as possible, with the aim of helping them become their own therapist. As soon as they start to feel better, it is important to Termination and Relapse Prevention 317 have a discussion about the course of recovery. Patients benefit from a visual depiction (Figure 18. 1) of the course of progress, with periods of improvement that are typically interrupted (temporarily) by plateaus, fluctuations, or setbacks. (Later you will stress that life after therapy may be marked by occasional setbacks or difficulties but that patients will be better equipped to handle them on their own. )Th e r a p i s T: I’m glad you’re feeling a little better. But I should tell you that you may still have ups and downs. Most people go along feel -ing a little better and a little better, then at some point, they reach a plateau or have a setback. Then they feel a little better and a little better, and then there may be another plateau or setback. So it’s normal to have ups and downs . . . Can you see why it’s important to remember that in the future? pa Ti e n T: I guess so I won’t worry so much about the down parts. Th e r a p i s T: Exactly. You can remember this discussion where we pre -dicted some low points. In fact, you might want to refer to a graph [Figure 18. 1]. This is a rough idea of what might happen. Do you see that the setbacks usually get fewer and shorter and generally less severe as time goes on? pa Ti e n T: Uh-huh. Th e r a p i s T: It’s important for you to remember this graph, because otherwise, when you have a setback, you might think that therapy doesn’t work, that you’ll never get better. FIGURE 18. 1. Progress in therapy. This graph, if skillfully drawn, can be made to resemble the southern border of the United States, with setbacks represented by “Texas” and “Florida. ” While striking some patients and therapists as humorous, this illustration may help patients recall that setbacks are normal. Improvement Time 318 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: You will probably have mild ups and downs even after therapy, because everyone does. Of course, by then, you’ll have the tools you need to help yourself. Or you may want to come in again for a session or two. We’ll discuss this toward the end of treatment. ACTIVITIES T HROUGHOUT T HERAPYCertain techniques should be used throughout treatment to facilitate relapse prevention. Attributing Progress to the Patient You should be alert at every session for opportunities to reinforce patients for their progress. When they experience an improvement in mood, find out why they think they are feeling better and reinforce the idea, whenever possible, that they have brought about changes in their mood by making changes in their thinking and behavior. Th e r a p i s T: It sounds as if your level of depression is lower this week. Why do you think that happened? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: Did you do anything differently this week? Did you go ahead and do the activities we scheduled? Or did you respond to your negative thoughts? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. I actually exercised every day, and I went out with friends twice. A few times I really criticized myself but I read my coping cards. Th e r a p i s T: Is it possible you’re feeling better this week because you did a number of things that helped? pa Ti e n T: Yes, I think so. Th e r a p i s T: So what can you say about how you made progress? pa Ti e n T: I guess when I do things to help myself, I do feel better. Some patients initially believe that all the credit for feeling better goes to their therapist. An alternative attribution—that the patient is responsible for positive changes—can fortify the patient’s sense of self-efficacy. Termination and Relapse Prevention 319 Th e r a p i s T: Why do you think you’re feeling better this week? pa Ti e n T: You really helped me last session. Th e r a p i s T: Well, I may have taught you some things, but who was it who actually changed your thinking and your behavior this week? pa Ti e n T: I guess I did. Th e r a p i s T: How much do you believe, then, that it’s really you who deserves the credit? Alternatively, patients may attribute all the improvement to a change in circumstance (e. g. , “I’m feeling better because my boyfriend called me”) or to medication. While you should acknowledge such external factors, you should also ask about changes in their thinking or behavior that could have contributed to or helped maintain their improvement. When patients persist in believing that they do not deserve credit, you might decide to elicit their underlying belief (“What does it mean to you that I’m trying to give you credit? ”). Teaching and Using Tools/Techniques Learned in Therapy When teaching patients techniques and tools, you will stress that these are lifelong aids the patient can use in a number of situations now and in the future—that is, these techniques are not specific to just one dis -order such as depression, but they can be used whenever patients real -ize they are reacting in an overly emotional or dysfunctional way. Com -mon techniques and tools that can be used during and after therapy include the following: 1. Breaking down big problems into manageable components. 2. Brainstorming solutions to problems. 3. Identifying, testing, and responding to automatic thoughts and beliefs. 4. Using Thought Records. 5. monitoring and scheduling activities. 6. Doing relaxation exercises. 7. Using distraction and refocusing techniques. 8. Creating hierarchies of avoided tasks or situations. 9. Writing credit lists. 10. Identifying advantages and disadvantages (of specific thoughts, beliefs, behaviors, or choices when making a decision). 320 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND You should help patients understand how they can use these tools in other situations during and after therapy:Th e r a p i s T: So identifying your depressing thoughts and then ques -tioning and responding to them really reduced how sad you felt? pa Ti e n T: Yes, it did. I was surprised. Th e r a p i s T: Did you know you could use these same tools whenever you feel you’re overreacting—when you think you feel more anger, anxiety, sadness, embarrassment, and so forth—than the situation calls for? pa Ti e n T: I hadn’t really thought about it. Th e r a p i s T: Now, I’m not saying you should try to get rid of all nega -tive emotion—only when you think you might be overreacting. Can you think of any other situations that came up in the last few weeks where it might have helped to use a Thought Record? pa Ti e n T: (Pauses . ) Nothing really comes to mind. Th e r a p i s T: Any situations coming up in the next few weeks where it might be helpful to use a Thought Record? pa Ti e n T: (Pauses . ) Well, I know I’m going to be really angry at my brother if he decides to stay at school for the summer instead of coming home. Th e r a p i s T: What do you think of doing a Thought Record on this situ -ation, writing down and then responding to your thoughts? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Preparing for Setbacks during Therapy As soon as patients begin to feel better, you will prepare them for a potential setback by asking them to imagine what will go through their mind if they start to feel worse. Common responses include: “I shouldn’t be feeling this way”; “This means I’m not getting better”; “I’m hopeless”; “I’ll never get well”; “My therapist will be disappointed”; or “My thera -pist isn’t doing a good job”; “Cognitive behavior therapy doesn’t work for me”; “I’m doomed to be depressed forever”; “It was only a fluke that I felt better initially”; or patients may report an image of themselves in the future, for example, feeling frightened, alone, sad, huddled in the corner of their bed. Coping cards and the Progress in Therapy graph (Figure 18. 1) can help avoid these negative cognitions. Termination and Relapse Prevention 321 Th e r a p i s T: Well, you’ve really been making nice progress. Your depres -sion seems to be lifting quite a bit. pa Ti e n T: I am feeling better. Th e r a p i s T: Do you remember that we talked about setbacks a couple of weeks ago? pa Ti e n T: A little. Th e r a p i s T: Since it’s possible you could have a setback, I’d like to dis -cuss in advance how you could handle it. pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: I’d like you to imagine for a moment that you’ve had a bad week. Nothing seems to have gone well. Everything looks black again. You’re really down on yourself. It seems hopeless. Can you get a picture of that in your mind? pa Ti e n T: Yes. It’s like it was before therapy. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. Tell me what’s going through your mind now. pa Ti e n T: (Pauses . ) It’s not fair. I was doing so well. This isn’t work -ing. Th e r a p i s T: Good. Now, how can you answer these thoughts? pa Ti e n T: I’m not sure. Th e r a p i s T: Well, you have a choice. You can continue to think these depressing thoughts. If you do, what do you predict will happen to your mood? pa Ti e n T: I’ll probably feel worse. Th e r a p i s T: Or you can remind yourself that this is only a setback, which is normal and temporary. Then how would you feel? pa Ti e n T: Better, probably, or at least not worse. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. Having reminded yourself that setbacks are normal, what kinds of things have you learned to do in the past few weeks that could help you? pa Ti e n T: I could read my therapy notes or get my mind off of it by con -centrating on what I have to do. Th e r a p i s T: Or both. pa Ti e n T: Right, or both. Th e r a p i s T: Is there a reason to expect that the tools which helped you before won’t help you again? 322 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: No. Th e r a p i s T: So you can respond to your negative thoughts and start concentrating on something else. Do you think it’s worth writing down what we just talked about—so you’ll have a plan in case you do have a setback at some point? NEAR T ERm INATION A CTIVITIESResponding to Concerns about Tapering Sessions Several weeks before termination, you should discuss tapering ses -sions, as an experiment, from once a week to once every other week. Although some patients readily agree to this arrangement, others may become anxious. It is useful for this latter group of patients to list ver -bally and perhaps record in writing the advantages of trying to reduce the frequency of visits. When patients fail to see advantages, you should first elicit disadvantages, use guided discovery to help patients identify advantages, and then help them reframe the disadvantages (see Figure 18. 2). Advantages of tapering therapy 1. I’ll have more opportunity to use and sharpen my tools. 2. I’ll be less dependent on [my therapist]. 3. I can use the therapy fee for other things. 4. I can spend more time [doing other things]. Disadvantages Reframe 1. I might relapse. If I’m going to relapse, it’s better for it to happen while I’m still in therapy so I can learn how to handle it. 2. I may not be able to solve problems myself. Tapering therapy gives me the chance to test my idea that I need [my therapist]. In the long run, it’s better for me to learn to solve problems myself, because I won’t be in therapy forever. 3. I’ll miss [my therapist]. This is probably true, but I’ll be able to tolerate it and it will encourage me to build up a support network. FIGURE 18. 2. Advantages and disadvantages (to Sally) of tapering therapy. Termination and Relapse Prevention 323 The following transcript illustrates how such a discussion might proceed:Th e r a p i s T: In our last session, we briefly discussed the possibility of experimenting with spacing our therapy sessions. Did you think about going to an every-other-week schedule on a trial basis? pa Ti e n T: I did. It made me a little anxious. Th e r a p i s T: What went through your mind? pa Ti e n T: Oh, what if something happens that I can’t deal with? What if I start getting more depressed—I couldn’t stand that. Th e r a p i s T: Did you evaluate these thoughts? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. I realized I was catastrophizing, that it wasn’t the abso -lute end of therapy. And you did say I could call you if I needed to. Th e r a p i s T: That’s right. Did you imagine a specific situation that might come up that would be difficult? pa Ti e n T: No, not really. Th e r a p i s T: Maybe it would help if we had you imagine a specific prob -lem now. pa Ti e n T: Okay. [Sally imagines getting a low grade on a test, identifies her automatic thoughts, responds to the thoughts, and makes a specific plan for what to do next. ]Th e r a p i s T: Now, let’s talk about the second automatic thought you had about spacing our sessions—that you’d get more depressed and that you wouldn’t be able to stand it. pa Ti e n T: I guess that may not be quite true. You’ve made me realize that I could stand to feel bad again. But I wouldn’t like it. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. Now let’s say you do get more depressed and it’s still a week and a half before our next session. What can you do? pa Ti e n T: Well, I can do what I did about a month ago. Reread my therapy notes, make sure I stay active, do more Thought Records. Somewhere in my notes I have a list of things to do. Th e r a p i s T: Would it be helpful to find that list now? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. How about for homework if you find the list and write a Thought Record for these two thoughts: “Something might happen that I couldn’t deal with, ” and “I couldn’t stand it if I got more depressed. ”pa Ti e n T: Okay. 324 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Th e r a p i s T: Any other thoughts about spacing our sessions? pa Ti e n T: Just that I’d miss not having you to talk to every week. Th e r a p i s T: I’ll miss that, too. Is there anyone else you could talk to, even a little? pa Ti e n T: Well, I could call Rebecca. And I guess I could call my brother. Th e r a p i s T: That sounds like a good idea. Do you want to write that down to do, too? pa Ti e n T: Okay. Th e r a p i s T: And finally, do you remember that we said we could experi -ment with every-other-week sessions? If it’s not working well, I do want you to call me so you can come in sooner. Responding to Concerns about Termination When patients are doing well with biweekly sessions, you might suggest scheduling the next appointment for 3 or 4 weeks in the future, in prep -aration for termination. Again, tapering can be viewed as an experi -ment. At each succeeding session, you and the patient agree either to continue spacing sessions or to return to more frequent sessions. As termination approaches, it is important to elicit patients’ auto -matic thoughts about termination. Some patients are excited and hope -ful. At the other extreme, some patients are fearful or even angry. Most have some mixed feelings. They are pleased with their progress but concerned about relapse. Often they are sorry to end their relationship with you. It is important both to acknowledge what patients are feeling and help them respond to any distortions. It is often desirable for you to express your own genuine feelings, if you can honestly say that you regret the (gradual) ending of the relationship but feel pride in what they have achieved in therapy and that you believe they are ready to make it on their own. Responding to other automatic thoughts and examining advantages and disadvantages of termination can be carried out in the same way as was previously described in responding to thoughts about tapering sessions. Additional strategies to help patients who are con -cerned about termination can be found in Ludgate (2009). Reviewing What Was Learned in Therapy You will encourage patients to read through and organize their notes so they can easily refer to them in the future. For example, a good home - Termination and Relapse Prevention 325 work assignment is to write a synopsis of the important points and skills they learned in treatment. Self-Therapy Sessions Although many patients do not follow through with formal self-therapy sessions, it is nevertheless useful to discuss a self-therapy plan (see Fig -ure 18. 3) and to encourage its use. When patients try self-therapy ses -sions while regular therapy sessions are still being tapered, they are much more likely to do self-therapy after termination. And they can discover potential problems: not having enough time, misunderstand -ings about what to do, and interfering thoughts (e. g. , “This is too much work”; “I don’t really need to do it”; “I can’t do it on my own”). In addi -tion to helping patients respond to these problems, you can remind patients of the advantages of self-therapy sessions: They are continuing therapy, but at their own convenience and without charge; they can keep their newly acquired tools fresh and ready to use; they can resolve difficulties before they become major problems; they reduce the pos -sibility of relapse; and they can use their skills to enrich their life in a variety of contexts. A generic self-therapy plan is presented in Figure 18. 3. You can review it with patients and tailor it to meet their needs. Many patients benefit from a brief discussion of a reminder system: “Initially, you might want to try a self-therapy session once a week, then taper it to once or twice a month, then to once a season, and eventually, to once a year. How could you remind yourself to pull out this self-therapy plan periodically? ”Preparing for Setbacks after Termination As mentioned previously, you begin preparing patients for setbacks early in treatment. As you near termination, you should encourage them to compose a coping card specifying what to do if a setback occurs after therapy has ended. (See Figure 18. 4 for a typical card. )It is desirable for patients to attempt to resolve their difficulties on their own before calling you. If they do need another appointment, you can help them discover what got in the way of their handling the setback or problem independently, and together you can plan what the patient can do differently in the future. 326 Reprinted by permission in Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Basics and Beyond, Second Edition , by Judith S.

Termination and Relapse Prevention 327 BOOSTER S ESSIONSYou should encourage patients to schedule booster sessions after ter -mination for several reasons. If any difficulties have arisen, you can discuss how patients handled them and assess whether they could have handled them in a better way. Together you can look ahead to the next several weeks and months and predict future difficulties that could arise. Then you can jointly formulate a plan to deal with these situa -tions. Knowing that you will ask them about their progress doing self-therapy may motivate patients to do their cognitive behavior therapy homework and practice their skills. In addition, you can help patients determine whether their previously modified dysfunctional beliefs have been reactivated. If so, they can do cognitive restructuring in session and plan for continued belief work at home. Booster sessions also afford you the opportunity to check on the reemergence of dysfunctional strategies (such as avoidance). Patients can express any new or previously unaccomplished goals and develop a plan to work toward them. Together you can evaluate their self-therapy program and modify as needed. Finally, when patients know they are scheduled for booster sessions after termination, their anxiety about maintaining progress on their own is usually alleviated. What I can do in case of a setback:1. I have a choice. I can catastrophize about the setback, get myself all upset, think things are hopeless, and probably feel worse. Or I can look back over my therapy notes, remember that setbacks are a normal part of recovery, and see what I can learn from this setback. Doing these things will probably make me feel better and make the setback less severe. 2. Next, I should have a self-therapy session and plan what to do to solve my problems. 3. I should call [a specific friend or family member] if I need more help. 4. I can call [my therapist] to briefly discuss what to do or to schedule another session. FIGURE 18. 4. Sally’s coping card about setbacks. 328 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND To prepare for booster sessions, you may provide patients with a list of questions (see Figure 18. 5). As the following transcript indicates, the overall goal for the booster session is to check on the patient’s well-being and plan for continued maintenance or progress. Th e r a p i s T: I’m glad you were able to come in today. It looks like, from the Beck Depression Inventory, that you’re a little more depressed than the last time we met. Is that right? pa Ti e n T: Yes, my girlfriend recently broke up with me. Th e r a p i s T: I’m sorry to hear that. Do you think that situation accounted for the rise in your score? pa Ti e n T: I think so. I was feeling pretty good until last week. Th e r a p i s T: Is the breakup something you’d like to put on the agenda to talk about today? pa Ti e n T: Yes, that and my progress, or rather lack of progress, in look -ing for a new job. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. And I’d like to find out how things have been going for you generally, aside from the breakup: whether you encoun -tered any other rough spots, how you dealt with them, how much cognitive behavior therapy homework you were able to do, any dif -ficulties you think may arise in the next 2 or 3 months. Does that sound okay? pa Ti e n T: Yes. Th e r a p i s T: Would you like to start with the breakup? Can you tell me how it came about? ( We briefly discuss the breakup. I am concerned with how the patient reacted to the breakup, whether his previous dysfunctional beliefs have become activated . ) [summarizing] So things had begun to deteriorate, and she told you she wanted to start seeing other guys? When she told you that, what went through your mind? pa Ti e n T: That she didn’t really love me. Th e r a p i s T: And what did that mean to you, that she didn’t love you? pa Ti e n T: That there must be something wrong with me. Th e r a p i s T: And what did you think was wrong with you? pa Ti e n T: That I’m not very lovable. Th e r a p i s T: How much did you believe that you weren’t very lovable right when she told you she wanted to see other men? pa Ti e n T: Oh, about 90%Th e r a p i s T: And how much do you believe it now? 329 Reprinted by permission in Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Basics and Beyond, Second Edition , by Judith S.

Th e r a p i s T: What made the difference? pa Ti e n T: Well, part of me knows that we probably just weren’t right for each other. Th e r a p i s T: So you were able to modify this old idea of not being lov -able? pa Ti e n T: Somewhat. Th e r a p i s T: Right. Now what did you learn from therapy that you can do to damp down this unlovable idea further and strengthen the idea that you are lovable? pa Ti e n T: A Thought Record might help. And I know my therapy notes have a lot on it. I should have gone back and reread them. Th e r a p i s T: That might have helped. Did you think of doing that? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. I guess I thought it really wouldn’t help. Th e r a p i s T: What do you think now? pa Ti e n T: Well, it helped me before, it should help me again. Th e r a p i s T: What would get in the way of going home and doing some work on it in the next couple of days? pa Ti e n T: Nothing. I’ll do it. I think it probably will help. Th e r a p i s T: Now might this thought, “It won’t help, ” pop up again the next time you’re going through a rough spot? pa Ti e n T: It might. Th e r a p i s T: What could you do now so it would be more likely that you’d test that thought? pa Ti e n T: What could I do now ? Th e r a p i s T: Yes. What could you do to remind yourself that you had the thought this time and then realized it might not be true? pa Ti e n T: I should write it down, maybe on a paper I keep in my desk. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, how about if you write down some of the things we just talked about—doing a Thought Record on being unlovable, reading through your therapy notes, writing a response to the thought “It won’t help. ”In this portion of the booster session, I assess the patient’s level of depression, set the agenda, discuss an issue, and help him set home -work for himself. I ascertain that he has only mild depressive symp -toms that seem primarily related to the breakup of the relationship. (Had the depression been more severe, I would have spent more time assessing triggers and identifying and modifying dysfunctional beliefs, Termination and Relapse Prevention 331 thoughts, and behaviors. We would also have discussed the advisability of additional sessions. )This patient is easily able to express his automatic thoughts and underlying belief. He and I spend little time developing a plan to help him modify his ideas; he had already learned the tools during therapy. He needed the booster session to remind and motivate himself to use the tools. In summary, relapse prevention is carried out throughout therapy. Problems in tapering sessions and in termination are addressed as any other problems, with a combination of problem solving and responding to dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs. 332 Chapter 19 TREATm ENT Pl ANNINGAt any given moment in therapy, how do you decide what to say or do next? Partial answers to this question have been provided through-out this book, but this chapter provides a more comprehensive frame-work for making decisions and planning treatment. To keep therapy focused and moving in the right direction, you continually ask yourself, “What is the specifi c problem here, and what am I trying to accom-plish? ” You are cognizant of your objectives in the current portion of the session, in the session as a whole, in the current stage of therapy, and in treatment as a whole. This chapter outlines a number of areas essential to effective treatment planning:Accomplishing broad therapeutic goals. • Planning treatment across sessions. • Devising treatment plans. • Planning individual sessions. • Deciding whether to focus on a problem. • modifying standard treatment for specifi c disorders. • Treatment Planning 333 ACCO m Pl ISHING B ROAD T HERAPEUTIC GOA l SAt the broadest level, your objectives are not only to facilitate a remis -sion of patients’ disorders but also to prevent relapse. To do the latter, you tell patients early in treatment that one of your goals is to teach them to become their own therapist. To achieve your objectives, you will:1. Build a sound therapeutic alliance with patients. 2. make the structure and the process of therapy explicit. 3. Teach patients the cognitive model and share your conceptualization with them. 4. Help alleviate their distress through a variety of techniques and problem solving. 5. Teach them how to use these techniques themselves, help them generalize the use of the techniques, and motivate them to use the techniques in the future. Pl ANNING T REAT m ENT ACROSS S ESSIONSYou develop a general plan for treatment and a specific plan for each individual session. Therapy can be viewed in three phases. In the beginning phase of treatment, you build a strong therapeutic alliance; identify and specify patients’ goals for therapy; solve problems; teach patients the cognitive model; get patients behaviorally activated (if they are depressed and withdrawn); educate patients about their dis -order; teach them to identify, evaluate, and respond to their automatic thoughts; socialize them (to do homework, set an agenda in therapy, and provide feedback); and instruct patients in coping strategies. In this first phase of therapy, you often take the lead in suggesting home -work assignments. In the middle phase of therapy, you continue working toward these objectives but also emphasize identifying, evaluating, and modifying patients’ beliefs. You share your conceptualization of patients with them and use both “intellectual” and “emotional” techniques to facilitate belief modification. You teach patients the skills they need to accom -plish their goals. In the final phase of therapy, the emphasis shifts to preparing for termination and preventing relapse. By this point, patients have become 334 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND much more active in therapy, taking the lead in setting the agenda, suggesting solutions to problems, taking therapy notes, and devising homework assignments. CREATING A T REAT m ENT Pl ANYou develop a treatment plan based on your evaluation of patients, their Axis I and Axis II symptoms and disorder(s), and their specific present -ing problems and goals. Sally, for example, set five goals in the first therapy session: to improve her schoolwork, decrease her anxiety about tests, spend more time with friends, join school activities, and have more fun. Based on her intake evaluation and these goals, I devised a general therapy plan (see Figure 19. 1). In each session, we worked on several of the areas specified in the plan based on what we had covered in the previous session(s), what Sally had done for homework, and what problems or topics Sally put on the agenda that day. You also take each individual problem or goal and do a critical analysis, either mentally or on paper (Figure 19. 2). Having formulated a general treatment plan, you adhere to it to a greater or lesser degree, revising it as necessary. Analyzing specific problems compels you to conceptualize patients’ difficulties in detail and to formulate a treatment plan tailored for them. Doing so also helps you focus each session, grasp the flow of therapy from one session to the next, and become more cognizant of progress. 1. Problem-solve how to improve her concentration, seek needed help in her courses, schedule time with friends, and join activities. 2. Help her identify, evaluate, and respond to automatic thoughts about herself, school, other people, and therapy, especially those that are particularly distressing and/or hinder her from solving problems. 3. Investigate dysfunctional beliefs about perfectionism and seeking help from others. 4. Discuss her self-criticism and increase giving herself credit. 5. Increase productive activity. FIGURE 19. 1.

Analysis of Problem 1: Difficulty studying. 336 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Pl ANNING I NDIVIDUA l SESSIONSBefore and during a session, you ask yourself a number of questions to formulate an overall plan for the session and to guide you as you conduct the therapy session. At the most general level, you ask yourself, “What am I trying to accomplish, and how can I do so most efficiently? ” Experienced therapists automatically reflect on many specific issues. The following list of questions, while potentially daunting to the begin -ner, is a useful guide for more advanced therapists who wish to improve their ability to make better decisions about how to proceed within a therapy session. The list is designed to be read and considered before a therapy session as conscious contemplation of the questions during a session would undoubtedly interfere with the therapeutic process. 1. As you review your notes from the previous session before the session , you ask yourself:a. “What is the patient’s disorder(s)? How, if at all, does standard cognitive behavior therapy need to be varied for treatment of this disorder and this patient in particular? ”b. “How have I conceptualized the patient’s difficulties? How, if at all, does standard cognitive behavior therapy need to be varied for this particular patient? ”c. “At which stage of therapy are we (beginning, middle, final)? How many sessions do we have left (if there is a limit)? ”d. “What progress have we made so far in the patient’s mood, behavior, symptoms? Toward the patient’s goals and major prob -lems? ”e. “How strong is our therapeutic alliance? What, if anything, do I need to do today to strengthen it? ”f. “At which cognitive level have we primarily been working: auto -matic thoughts, intermediate beliefs, core beliefs, or a mixture? How much progress have we made at each level? ”3. Use Socratic questioning to evaluate automatic thoughts. Teach use of Thought Record. 4. Use guided discovery to uncover meaning of automatic thoughts; put in conditional (If . . . then . . . ) format and test. 5. If applicable, use cognitive continuum to illustrate that achievement is on a continuum, rather than consisting of either perfection or failure. FIGURE 19. 2. (cont. ) Treatment Planning 337 g. “What behavioral changes have we been working toward? How much progress have we made? ”h. “What happened in the last few therapy sessions? What dysfunc -tional ideas or problems (if any) have hindered therapy? What skills have we been working on? Which one(s) do I want to rein -force? Which new skills do I want to teach? ”i. “What happened in the last session? What homework did the patient agree to do? What, if anything, did I agree to do (e. g. , call patient’s health care provider or find relevant bibliother -apy)? ” 2. As you begin the therapy session and check on the patient’s mood , you ask yourself:a. “How has the patient been feeling since our last session com -pared to earlier in treatment? Which moods predominate (e. g. , sadness, hopelessness, anxiety, anger, shame)? ”b. “Do objective scores match the patient’s subjective description? If not, why not? ”c. “Is there anything about the patient’s mood we should put on the agenda to discuss more fully? ” 3. As the patient provides a brief review of the week , you ask yourself:a. “How did this week go compared to previous weeks? ”b. “What signs of progress are there? What positive experiences did the patient have? ”c. “What problems came up this week? ”d. “Did anything happen this week (positive or negative) that we should put on the agenda to discuss more fully? ” 4. As you check on the patient’s use of alcohol, drugs, and medication (if applicable), you ask yourself:a. “Is there a problem in any of these areas? If so, should we put it on the agenda to discuss more fully? ” 5. As you and the patient set the agenda , you ask yourself:a. “Which problem is most important to the patient? Which is the most solvable? Which one is likely to bring about symptom relief within today’s session and in the coming week? ” 6. As you and the patient prioritize agenda items , you ask yourself:a. “How much time will each agenda item take? How many items can we discuss? ”b. “Are there any problems the patient could resolve alone, or with 338 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND someone else, or bring up at another session? How much time should we allot to each chosen item/problem? ” 7. As you and the patient review the homework , you ask yourself:a. “How is the patient’s homework related to the agenda items? Should discussion of any of the homework tasks be postponed until we get to a specific agenda item? ”b. “How much of the homework did the patient do? What, if any -thing, got in the way? ”c. “How much does the patient agree with each statement in the therapy notes from last week? In therapy notes from previous weeks (if still relevant)? How relevant are the therapy notes to the problems on today’s agenda? ”d. “Was the homework useful? If not, why not? If so, what did the patient learn? ”e. “Which homework tasks (if any) would be beneficial for the patient to continue in the coming week? ”f. “How, if at all, should we modify homework assigned in this ses -sion to make it more effective? ” 8. As you and the patient discuss the first agenda item , you ask yourself questions in four areas:Defining the Problema. “What is the specific problem? ”b. “In which specific situations did the problem arise? If it arose more than once, in which situation did the patient feel most upset or behave most dysfunctionally? ”c. “Why does the patient believe he has this problem? Why do I think the patient has this problem? ”d. “How does this problem fit into the overall cognitive conceptual -ization of the patient? How does it relate to his overall goals? ”Devising a Strategya. “What has the patient already done to try to solve the prob -lem? ”b. “What would I do if I were in the patient’s position and had this problem? ”c. “Can we do outright problem solving? What thoughts and beliefs might interfere with problem solving or carrying out a solution? ”Choosing Techniquesa. “What specifically am I trying to accomplish as we discuss this agenda item? ” Treatment Planning 339 b. “Which techniques have worked well for this patient (or for similar patients) in the past? Which techniques have not worked well? ”c. “Which technique should I try first? ”d. “How will I evaluate its effectiveness? ”e. “Will I employ the technique or employ it and teach it to the patient? ”Monitoring the Processa. “Are we working together as a team? ”b. “Is the patient having interfering automatic thoughts about him -self, this technique, our therapy, me, the future? ”c. “Is the patient’s mood lifting? How well is this technique work -ing? Should I try something else? ”d. “Will we finish discussion of this agenda item in time? If not, should we collaboratively decide to continue this item and cur -tail or eliminate discussion of another item? ”e. “What follow-up (i. e. , homework assignment) might be benefi -cial? ”f. “What should we record for the patient to review at home? ” 9. Following discussion of the first agenda item , you ask yourself:a. “How is the patient feeling now? ”b. “Do I need to do anything to reestablish rapport? ”c. “How much time is left in the session? Do we have time for another agenda item? What should we do next? ”10. Before closing the session , you ask yourself:a. “Did we make progress? Is the patient feeling better? ”b. “Is the patient committed to doing the homework we agreed on? ”c. “Do I need to probe for negative feedback? If there was negative feedback, how should I address it? ”11. After the session , you ask yourself:a. “How should I refine my conceptualization? ”b. “What do I want to remember to address in the next session? Future sessions? ”c. “Do I need to attend to our relationship? ”d. “How would I score myself on each item of the Cognitive Ther -apy Rating Scale [Appendix C]? If I could do the session over again, what would I do differently? ” 340 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND DECIDING W HETHER TO f OCUS ON A P ROB l Em A critical decision in every therapy session is which problem (or prob -lems) to pursue. Although you collaborate in making this decision with patients, you nevertheless guide therapy toward discussion of problems that are distressing and ongoing (or recurrent) and toward which you judge you will be able to make some progress during the session. You tend to limit discussion of problems that:Patients can solve themselves, • Are isolated incidents unlikely to recur, and/or• Are not particularly distressing. • Having identified and specified a problem, you do several things to help you decide how much time and effort to spend on the problem. You:1. Gather more data about the problem. 2. Review your options. 3. Reflect on practical considerations. 4. Use the stage of therapy as a guide. 5. Change the focus when necessary. These five steps are described below. Gathering More Data about a Problem When patients first bring up a problem or when the existence of a prob -lem becomes apparent in the midst of a session, you assess the nature of the problem to determine whether it seems worthwhile to intervene. For example, Sally has put a new problem on the agenda: Her father’s business is failing, and Sally feels sad. I question her to assess how use -ful it will be to devote a significant portion of therapy time to this prob -lem. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, you said you wanted to bring up something about your dad and his business? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. His business has been pretty rocky for a while, but now it looks as if it may go bankrupt. Th e r a p i s T: [gathering more information] If it does go bankrupt, how will that affect you? Treatment Planning 341 pa Ti e n T: Oh, nothing directly. I just feel so bad for him. I mean, he’ll still have enough money but . . . he’s worked really hard for this. Th e r a p i s T: [trying to discover whether there is a distortion in Sally’s thinking] What do you think will happen if it does go bankrupt? pa Ti e n T: Well, he’s already started looking for a new business. He’s not the type to just lie around or take time off. Th e r a p i s T: [still assessing whether Sally is thinking dysfunctionally] What’s the worst part of this to you? pa Ti e n T: Just that he probably feels bad. Th e r a p i s T: How do you feel when you think about his feeling badly? pa Ti e n T: Bad . . . sad. Th e r a p i s T: How sad? pa Ti e n T: A medium amount, I guess. Th e r a p i s T: [testing whether Sally can take a long view] Do you have a sense that though he may feel badly initially, he won’t stay that way indefinitely? That he’ll probably get involved in another business and feel better? pa Ti e n T: Yeah, I think that’ll probably happen. Th e r a p i s T: Do you think you’re feeling “normal” sadness over this? Or do you think this is affecting you too strongly? pa Ti e n T: I think I’m having a normal reaction. Th e r a p i s T: [having assessed no further work on this problem is war -ranted] Anything else on this? pa Ti e n T: No, I don’t think so. Th e r a p i s T: Okay. I’m sorry this happened to your dad. Let me know what happens. pa Ti e n T: I will. Th e r a p i s T: Should we turn to the next item on our agenda? In another situation, you determine that a problem does require intervention. Th e r a p i s T: You wanted to talk about living arrangements for next year? pa Ti e n T: Yes. I’m pretty upset. My roommate and I have decided to live together again. She wants to live off campus. So we have to look for an apartment in West Philly or Center City. But she’s going home for spring vacation so it’s mostly up to me to find a place. Th e r a p i s T: When were you feeling the most upset about this? 342 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND pa Ti e n T: Yesterday, when I agreed to start looking while she was away . . . Actually, it was last night when I realized I didn’t know what to do. Th e r a p i s T: How were you feeling? pa Ti e n T: Overwhelmed . . . anxious. Th e r a p i s T: As you were thinking about this last night, what was going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: What am I going to do? I don’t even know where to start. Th e r a p i s T: [seeking a fuller picture; determining whether there were other important automatic thoughts] What else was going through your mind? pa Ti e n T: I was feeling overwhelmed. I didn’t know what to do first, like should I go to a real estate agent? Should I look online? Th e r a p i s T: [probing for additional thoughts] Were you having any thoughts about your roommate? pa Ti e n T: No, not really. She said she’d help when she got back. She said I didn’t have to start looking until then. Th e r a p i s T: Were you making any predictions? pa Ti e n T: I don’t know. Th e r a p i s T: [giving an opposite example] Well, were you thinking you’d easily find a great place with a cheap rent? pa Ti e n T: No . . . no, I was thinking, “What if I find a place and it turns out to be infested with cockroaches, or unsafe, or too noisy, or in really bad shape? ”Th e r a p i s T: Did you have an image like that in your mind? pa Ti e n T: Yeah. Dark, smelly, dirty. ( Shudders . )Reviewing the Options Now that I have a fuller picture, I mentally review my options. I could do one or more of the following:1. Engage Sally in straightforward problem solving, helping her decide which steps seem the most reasonable and feasible. 2. Teach Sally problem-solving skills, using this problem as an example. 3. Use this situation as an opportunity to reinforce the cognitive model. 4. Use this situation as an opportunity to help Sally conceptualize her larger difficulty of assuming she is incompetent in a new situation and feeling overwhelmed instead of testing this belief. Treatment Planning 3435. Have Sally identify the most distressing thought and help her evaluate it. 6. Teach Sally how to do a Thought Record using this situation. 7. Use the image she described as an opportunity to teach her imagery techniques. 8. make a collaborative decision with Sally to move on to the next agenda item (perhaps to an even more pressing problem) and to return to this problem later in the session or in a future session. Reflecting on Practical Considerations How do you decide which course to pursue? I took into account a num -ber of factors, including:1. What is likely to bring Sally substantial relief? 2. What do we have time to do? What else do we need to do in the session? 3. What skills would be valuable to teach or review with Sally for which this problem provides an opportunity? 4. What, if anything, could Sally do herself (i. e. , for homework) to relieve her distress? f or example, if Sally could do a Thought Record on this at home, we can spend session time on other things that will speed her progress. Using the Stage of Therapy as a Guide You are often guided by a patient’s stage of therapy. For example, you may avoid tackling a complex (but non-emergency) problem in the first few sessions with depressed patients if it is unlikely that you will make much headway toward solving it. Focusing on easier problem that are solvable, or partially solvable, engenders hope in patients and makes them more motivated to work in therapy. Changing the Focus in a Session Sometimes you can’t easily assess how difficult a problem will be or how likely it is that a particular discussion will activate a painful core belief. In these cases, you may initially focus on a problem but switch to another topic when you realize your interventions are not successful 344 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND and/or the patient is experiencing greater (unintended) distress. Fol -lowing is a transcript from an early therapy session. Th e r a p i s T: Okay, next on the agenda. You said you’d like to meet more people. ( We discuss this goal more specifically . ) Now, how could you meet new people this week? pa Ti e n T: (in a meek voice ) I could talk to people at work. Th e r a p i s T: (noticing that the patient suddenly looks downcast ) What’s going through your mind right now? pa Ti e n T: It’s hopeless. I’ll never be able to do it. I’ve tried this before. (Appears angry . ) All my other therapists have tried this, too. But, I’m telling you, I just can’t do it! It won’t work! I hypothesize from the patient’s sudden negative affect shift that a core belief has been activated. I recognize that continuing in the same vein at this time will likely be counterproductive. Instead of refocusing on the problem, I decide to repair the therapeutic alliance by eliciting the patient’s angry automatic thoughts (“When I asked you how you could meet more people this week, what went through your mind? ”) and then helping her evaluate these thoughts. Later I gave the patient a choice about whether to return to this agenda item:Th e r a p i s T: I’m glad you can see that I hadn’t intended to make you do things you’re not ready for. Now, would you like to return to the topic of meeting new people, or should we come back to it another time [at another session] and move on to the problem you had this week with your friend Elise? In summary, early in treatment you tend to guide discussion away from problems you are unlikely to be successful in solving or partially solving (if patients are agreeable to postponing discussion about them). At any point, you avoid focusing on problems that patients can resolve on their own, that they do not want to work on, or that are not particu -larly distressing to them. m ODI f YING S TANDARD T REAT m ENT f OR S PECI f IC D ISORDERSIt is essential that you have a solid understanding of patients’ current symptoms and functioning, presenting problems, precipitating events, history, and diagnosis before starting therapy. You will need to con -sult specialized texts for patients whose primary disorder is not a sim - Treatment Planning 345 ple, unipolar depression to educate yourself about key cognitions and behavioral strategies for the various psychiatric disorders. In summary, effective treatment planning requires a sound diagno -sis, a solid formulation of the case in cognitive terms, and consideration of the patient’s characteristics and problems. Treatment is tailored to the individual; you develop an overall strategy as well as a specific plan for each session, considering the following:1. Patients’ diagnosis(es). 2. A conceptualization of their difficulties (which you check out with patients for accuracy). 3. Their goals for therapy. 4. Their most pressing concerns. 5. Your goals for therapy. 6. The stage of treatment. 7. Patients’ learning characteristics, their stage of life, developmental and intellectual level, gender, and cultural background. 8. Patients’ level of motivation. 9. The nature and strength of the therapeutic alliance. You develop and continually modify a general plan for treatment across sessions and a more specific plan before each session and within each session. 346 Chapter 20 PROBl Em S IN THERAPYProblems of one kind or another arise with nearly every patient in cognitive behavior therapy. Even experienced therapists encoun-ter diffi culties at times in establishing a therapeutic alliance, correctly conceptualizing a patient’s diffi culties, or consistently working toward joint objectives. A reasonable goal is not to avoid problems altogether but rather to learn to uncover and specify problems, to conceptualize how they arose, and to plan how to remediate them. It is useful to view problems or stuck points in therapy as opportuni-ties for you to refi ne your conceptualization of the patient. In addition, problems in therapy often provide insight into problems the patient experiences outside the offi ce. Finally, diffi culties with one patient pro-vide an opportunity for you to refi ne your own skills, to promote your fl exibility and creativity, and to gain new understandings and expertise in helping other patients, as problems can arise not just because of the patient’s characteristics but also because of the therapist’s relative weak-nesses. This chapter describes how to uncover the existence of prob-lems and how to conceptualize and remediate problems at stuck points in therapy. UNCOVERING THE Ex ISTENCE Of A PROBl Em You can uncover a problem in a number of ways: Problems in Therapy 3471. By listening to patients’ unsolicited feedback. 2. By directly soliciting patients’ feedback, whether or not they have provided verbal or nonverbal signals of a problem. 3. By reviewing recordings of therapy sessions alone or with a colleague or supervisor and rating the tape on the Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (Appendix C). 4. By tracking progress according to objective tests and the patient’s subjective report of symptom relief. A problem obviously exists when patients provide you with nega -tive feedback (e. g. , “I don’t think you understand what I’m saying, ” or “I understand what you’re saying intellectually but not in my gut”). Many patients, however, allude indirectly to a problem (e. g. , “I see what you’re saying, but I don’t know if I could do it any other way, ” or, “I’ll try” [implying that they believe they will be unsuccessful in carrying out a task]). In these cases, you should question the patient further to ascer -tain whether a problem does indeed exist and to determine the dimen -sions of the problem. Many times, however, the patient fails to relate, either directly or indirectly, a problem with therapy. You can discover problems if you adhere to the standard structure of the session (which includes ask -ing the patient for feedback at the end of the session), by periodically checking on the depth of the patient’s understanding during the ses -sion, and by eliciting the patient’s automatic thoughts when you notice an affect shift during the session. For example, on one occasion I sensed through Sally’s nonverbal cues (a faraway look in her eyes, restless shifting in her seat) that she was not fully processing what I was saying or that she did not agree. I asked her what was going through her mind. I took other steps through -out our session to make sure that Sally and I shared an understanding. I took care either to summarize often during the session or to ask Sally to summarize. I also asked her to rate how much she believed the sum -mary (e. g. , “Sally, we’ve just been talking about the idea that you’re not completely responsible for your mother’s unhappiness even though you moved away from home . . . How much do you believe that now? ”). I further checked on Sally’s understanding at different points dur -ing the session (e. g. , “Is it clear to you why else your roommate might be reacting in this way? . . . Could you put it in your own words? ”). I also made sure to elicit feedback at the end of the session (e. g. , “Anything I said today that bothered you? . . . Anything you thought I didn’t under -stand? ”). Because I guessed that Sally might hesitate to give me nega - 348 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND tive feedback, I also asked very specifically for feedback about a portion of the session during which I suspected she might have had a negative reaction: “How about when I suggested that you might be able to be more assertive with your mother? Did that bother you? . . . Do you think you would be able to tell me if it had bothered you? ”In summary, you should seek to allay or to uncover problems within a therapy session by checking on patients’ understanding, by asking for feedback, and by raising suspected problems directly during the session itself. You may also ask patients to complete a written evaluation of a session (page 77) that you can review with them at the next session. If you are a novice therapist, you may be unaware of the existence of a problem and/or be less able to specify a problem. You should solicit permission to record therapy sessions to review on your own or (pref -erably) with an experienced cognitive behavior therapist. Obtaining patients’ consent is usually not a problem if you present it in a positive light: “I have an unusual opportunity for you that I’m only offering a few patients [or that I’m only offering to you]. You should feel free to say yes or no. I occasionally record therapy sessions so I can listen to them later and figure out how I might be able to help patients more. [If relevant, “I may play them to a colleague [or supervisor] to get feed -back. I always find that two heads are better than one. ”] I’ll delete or erase the recording immediately afterward. ( pause ) Is it okay with you if we start out taping the session? If it bothers you after a few minutes, we can always turn it off or get rid of the recording at the end. ”Another clear indication of a problem is a lack of progress or dete -rioration in a patient’s functioning and/or mood (identified through self-report or objective tests such as the Beck Depression Inventory [see Appendix B]. You might suggest this lack of progress as an agenda item and collaborate with the patient in planning a more effective direction for treatment. Finally, you should continually try to put yourself in patients’ shoes, to see how they view their world and to reveal what obstacles might inhibit their ability to take a more functional perspective of their diffi -culties (e. g. , “If I were Sally, how would I feel during therapy? What would I think when my therapist said or ? ”). CONCEPTUA l Iz ING P ROB l Em SHaving identified the existence of a problem, be alert for automatic thoughts blaming the patient (e. g. , “He’s resistant/manipulative/unmo -tivated”). These labels tend to alleviate a therapist’s sense of responsi -bility for resolving the difficulty and interfere with problem solving. Instead, ask yourself: Problems in Therapy 349“What has the patient said (or not said) or done (or not done) in session (or between sessions) that is a problem? ”Next, you ideally would consult with a supervisor who has reviewed a recording of the therapy session. You will undoubtedly need help in determining whether the problem is due to the patient’s pathology, errors you have made, treatment factors (such as the level of care, for -mat of therapy, session frequency), and/or factors external to treatment (e. g. , an organic disease, a psychologically toxic home or work environ -ment, ineffective medication or deleterious side effects, an absence of needed adjunctive treatments; see J. S. Beck, 2005). Having identified a problem that calls for a change in what you are doing, you will conceptualize the level at which the problem occurred:1. Is it merely a technical problem ? for example, did you use an inappropriate technique or use a technique incorrectly? 2. Is it a more complex problem with the session as a whole ? for example, did you correctly identify a dysfunctional cognition but then fail to intervene effectively? 3. Is there an ongoing problem across several sessions ? for example, has there been a breakdown in collaboration? Typically, problems occur in one or more of the following catego -ries:1. Diagnosis, conceptualization, and treatment planning. 2. Therapeutic alliance. 3. Structure and/or pace of the session. 4. Socialization of the patient. 5. Dealing with automatic thoughts. 6. Accomplishing therapeutic goals in and across sessions. 7. Patients’ processing of the session content. The following questions can help you and your supervisor specify the nature of a therapeutic problem. Then you can formulate, priori -tize, and select one or more specific objectives on which to focus. 350 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Diagnosis, Conceptualization, and Treatment Planning DIAGNOSIS 1. “Have I made a correct diagnosis on the five axes according to the latest DSM? ”2. “Is a medication consult indicated for this patient? ”CONCEPTUA l Iz ATION 1. “Do I use a Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram [page 200] to identify the patient’s most central dysfunctional cognitions and behaviors? ”2. “Do I continually refine my conceptualization as I get new data and share my conceptualization with the patient at strategically appro -priate times?

The experienced therapist, in lieu of the preceding questions, may first wish to rule in or rule out five key problem areas. Having determined that you have a cor -rect diagnosis, conceptualization, and treatment plan tailored for the patient’s disorder (and have correctly employed techniques), you assess the following, alone or with a consultant:1. Do the patient and I have a solid therapeutic alliance ? 2. Do we both have a clear idea of the patient’s goals for therapy? Is he committed to working toward his goals? 3. Does the patient truly believe the cognitive model —that his thinking influences his mood and behavior, that his thinking at times is dysfunctional, and that evaluating and responding to dysfunctional thinking positively affect how he feels emotionally and how he behaves? 4. Is the patient socialized to cognitive behavior therapy—does he contribute to the agenda, collaboratively work toward solving problems, do homework, provide feedback? 5. Is the patient’s biology (e. g. , illness, medication side effects, or inadequate level of medication) or his external environment 356 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND (e. g. , an abusive partner, an extremely demanding job, or an intolerable level of poverty or crime in his environment) interfering with your work together? REm EDIATING P ROB l Em S IN T HERAPYDepending on the identified problem, you might consider the advis -ability of one or more of the following: 1. Doing a more in-depth diagnostic evaluation. 2. Referring the patient for a physical or neuropsychological examination. 3. Refining your conceptualization of the patient and checking it out with him. 4. Reading more about the treatment of the patient’s Axis I (and Axis II) disorder(s). 5. Seeking specific feedback from the patient about his experience of therapy and of you. 6. Reestablishing the patient’s goals for therapy (and possibly examining the advantages and disadvantages of working toward and accomplishing them). 7. Identifying and responding to your own automatic thoughts about the patient or about your skill as a therapist. 8. Reviewing the cognitive model with the patient and eliciting any doubts or misunderstandings he may have. 9. Reviewing the treatment plan with the patient (and eliciting his concerns or doubts about it). 10. Reviewing the patient’s responsibilities (and eliciting his reactions). 11. Emphasizing setting and reviewing homework in session and accomplishment of homework throughout the week. 12. Working consistently on key automatic thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors across sessions. 13. Checking on the patient’s understanding of session content and having him record the most important points. 14. Based on the patient’s needs and preferences, changing (in one direction or the other) the pace or structure of the session, the amount or difficulty of material covered, the degree of empathy Problems in Therapy 357 you have been expressing, the degree to which you have been didactic or persuasive, and/or the relative focus on problem solving. You should monitor your own thoughts and mood when seeking to conceptualize and remediate problems in therapy because your cogni -tions may at times interfere with problem solving. It is likely that all ther -apists, at least occasionally, have negative thoughts about patients, the therapy, and/or themselves as therapists. Typical therapist assumptions that interfere with making changes to the therapy format include:“If I interrupt the patient, he’ll think I’m controlling him. ”“If I structure the session with an agenda, I’ll miss something important. ”“If I record a session, I’ll be too self-conscious. ”“If my patient gets annoyed with me, she’ll drop out of therapy. ”Finally, when you encounter a problem in treatment, you have a choice. You can catastrophize about the problem and/or blame yourself or the patient. Alternatively, you can turn the problem into an oppor -tunity to refine your skills of conceptualization and treatment planning and to improve your technical expertise and your ability to vary therapy in accordance with the specific needs of each patient. 358 Chapter 21 PROGRESSING AS A COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPISTThis chapter briefl y outlines steps to initiate the practice of standard cognitive behavior therapy. You should gain experience with the basic techniques of cognitive behavior therapy by practicing them your-self before doing so with patients. (See Appendix B for information on obtaining patient worksheets, tests, and booklets. ) Trying the tech-niques yourself allows you to correct diffi culties in application and put-ting yourself in the patient’s role affords you the opportunity to identify obstacles (practical or psychological) that interfere with carrying out assignments. At a minimum, if you wish to become profi cient in cog-nitive behavior therapy, you should do the following (if you have not already done so):1. Monitor your moods and identify your automatic thoughts when you experience dysphoria or anxiety, when you engage in maladaptive behavior, and/or avoid engaging in adaptive behavior. 2. Write down your automatic thoughts. If you skip this step, you deprive yourself of the opportunity to discover potential obstacles that your patients may have in writing down their thoughts: lack of opportu-nity, motivation, time, energy, and hope. When employing a technique such as assigning homework in session, you can then make a rapid com-parison between yourself and the patient. You think, “Would I have diffi culty doing this assignment? What would I need to become moti-vated? What would get in the way of my doing it? Do I need to present Progressing as a Cognitive Behavior Therapist 359 it in a more step-by-step fashion? ” In other words, your progress as a cognitive behavior therapist is facilitated if you bring an understanding of yourself and human nature in general to treatment. 3. Identify your automatic thoughts that interfere with carrying out the step above. Thoughts such as “I don’t have to write my automatic thoughts down, ” or “I know this stuff. I can get by with doing this in my head, ” are likely to impede your progress. A good adaptive response would acknowledge the partial truth of these thoughts but emphasize the advantages of behaving otherwise: “It’s true that I can probably get by without using cognitive behavior therapy tools on myself. But it’s also true that I will probably learn considerably more if I go ahead and write things down. I’ll better understand why my patients have difficulty if I myself go through the same process first to see what it feels like and spot potential trouble spots. What’s the big deal anyway? It’ll only take a couple of minutes. ”4. Once you have become proficient at identifying your automatic thoughts and emotions, start doing one Thought Record a day when you notice your mood changing. If your thoughts are not distorted, though, or if you tend automatically to respond adaptively to your thoughts in your head, doing a TR may not lead to a change in your affect. (Remem -ber that cognitive behavior therapists do not try to eliminate negative emotion; they try to reduce dysfunctional degrees of emotion. ) However, whether or not you personally benefit from doing TRs, doing them will sharpen your skill in teaching your patients to do them. 5. Fill out the bottom half of the Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram using three typical situations in which you felt dysphoric or behaved in a maladaptive way. If you have difficulty specifying the situ -ation, identifying your thoughts or emotions, or uncovering the mean -ing of your thoughts, reread the relevant chapters in this book. 6. Continue to fill in the top half of the Cognitive Conceptualiza -tion Diagram. When you feel distressed, see whether there is a theme in the category of helplessness, unlovability, or worthlessness underneath. Once you have identified a core belief, fill in the other boxes. 7. Next, using a core belief identified in the prior exercises, fill out a Core Belief Worksheet (page 243). Examine your interpretation of situations to determine whether you are distorting evidence to sup -port a negative core belief and/or if you are ignoring or discounting evidence contrary to this core belief. Note: This exercise may not affect your belief system if you have positive, counterbalancing beliefs that are continuously activated, but completing the worksheet will at least make you more familiar with it and more likely to use it effectively with patients. 8. Try other basic techniques: activity scheduling, credit lists, responding to spontaneous imagery, acting “as if, ” writing and reading "}
