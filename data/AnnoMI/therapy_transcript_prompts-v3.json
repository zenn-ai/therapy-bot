That's at least 12 drinks a week."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Something like that."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. Just so you know, my role, um, when we talk about alcohol use, is just to share information about risk and to help patients who want help. This is different than telling them what I think they should do. I don't do that."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Okay."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Uh, what else can you tell me about your drinking."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, I usually drink when I'm at home trying to unwind and I drink while I'm watching a movie.

So, can I share with you some information on alcohol use?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Okay."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. So, there has been a lot of research on alcohol use and the guidelines we use in this country says that having seven or more drinks per week can raise the risk of health problems for women."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Hmm. Seven?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Seven."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Wow. I knew my doctor didn't like me drinking the amount that I did but I didn't know that seven was the limit."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yeah, you're surprised to hear that?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yes. What-what kind of health problems?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Well things like heart disease, cancer, liver problems, uh, stomach pains, insomnia. Unfortunately, uh, people who drink at a risky level are more likely to be diagnosed with depression and alcohol can make depression worse or harder to treat."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Hmm. Well, that's not good news."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Well, how do you think your drinking relates to the depression you've experienced?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, to be honest, I drink sometimes when I'm feeling down and I find it more interesting and not so blur."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. And how do you feel after you drink?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, then I feel blur again."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So, there are some answers on this form here.

I sometimes finish a bottle in one night."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So you're not proud of finishing a bottle?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "No, it's not like I get crazy or anything but I just don't like the amount that I'm drinking."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Right. By the way, binge drinking is defined for women as having more than, uh, three drinks and there are about five drinks in a bottle. So, you enjoy drinking wine because it helps make things, uh, a little bit more interesting when you're feeling down but at the same time you don't like drinking when you have more than you want it to and then the depression returns after you drink."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Mm-hmm. Yes, sometimes I feel worse after drinking."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Where do you wanna go from here? What do you wanna change about your drinking habits?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, I don't think that I'm ready to cut down to seven drinks a week.

I think that would be my goal."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "If I gave you a scale from 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to cut back on drinking and 10 being very ready, what number would you be at?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "I'd say an eight."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. Why do you think it's not something less like a six?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, I'm more ready than a six because I'm ready to cut back on my drinking and I don't wanna make my depression any worse."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "What would help you cut back to two drinks?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Maybe having less wine in the house."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Having less wine in the house will help?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yes."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "What else besides drinking helps you relax and unwind in the evenings?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, I like to watch movies, read a book, and take a bath but sometimes I drink when I take a bath."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So, it's not just wine that helps you relax. Um, there's reading a book, watching a movie, and taking a hot bath too."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Mm-hmm. Yes."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay.

I'd be interested to see how well you do on your goal in the next few weeks. Would you be willing to come back and talk to me about it?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Sure."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Great. So, let's see how well you're doing with these new meds."}], "issue": "The patient is seeing the therapist because she drinks alcohol to relax and unwind, however, her drinking has been causing health problems and making her depression worse.

And then when you do drink alcohol, you typically have five or six drinks."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah. Uh, maybe a couple more."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. Well, the reason why I like to talk to patients when they fill out this form is because sometimes, uh, alcohol use can impact our health. Um, and my role is to be helpful. I can share some information with you about alcohol use, um, but I don't tell anyone what to do. It's always up to the patient to decide what they wanna do about their drinking. Um, so is it okay if we talk a little bit more about your alcohol use?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "So, uh, are you saying I drink too much?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "How would you define drinking too much?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, I-- If-if I was getting fallen down drunk or if I drink every night. Um, it's not like I get sloppy drunk or anything."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm. Well, in this country, the guidelines are men can drink up to 14 drinks a week or up to four on one occasion and still be low risk."}, {"from": "human", "value": "So I'm already at the week limit. And then I have four beers a night. Are you sure?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So a limit of four a night doesn't feel right to you?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "I have five or six beers when I go out with friends to a bar. It's not a problem for me."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "You're not alone in feeling that way.

I have about five or six beers throughout the entire evening."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm. Well, technically, we define binge drinking as having more than four drinks on one occasion."}, {"from": "human", "value": "But I'm healthy. What health problems are you talking about?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Well, uh, we know if someone binge drinks over time, there's kind of two categories of risk. There's the short-term risk where someone who binge drinks is more likely to fall down, hurt themselves through an accident, uh, they're more likely to drive while under the influence. Uh, but over the long term, binge drinking can also, uh, cause things like heart disease, uh, different kinds of cancer, liver problems obviously, and then even mental health issues like depression and anxiety are more likely to happen."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, I didn't know about those things."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Can I ask you, uh, what do you like about drinking alcohol?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, I-I like beer. I like the way it tastes, I like the way it makes me feel. Uh, like when I'm around friends and it's not a problem for me."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "And so what about your drinking do you not like or is there anything that worries you about your drinking?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, that was fine until I came here, uh, but now that I know about the health risk, uh, I have something I gotta think about."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So, on one hand, you like how beer tastes, uh, it's part of your social life to some extent, um, but on the other hand, you don't like the idea of it posing risks to your health over the long term?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "E-exactly."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So weighing those things, you know, what you like about your drinking, what you don't like about your drinking, uh, where do you wanna go from here? Uh, what would you like to change about your drinking?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Hmm, I'm not sure. Uh, something I have to think about."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Well, how about hypothetically if I were to ask you, how would your drinking have to impact your life in order for you to be ready to change your drinking?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Uh, I don't know. Maybe if I got sick or something, uh, maybe I'd wanna change things then."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So if you experienced a negative consequence from your drinking, uh, that would feel meaningful to you?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. Well, I like to give this handout to patients. Uh, it defines risky drinking, it talks about what the consequences are, uh, and it also lists signs of what an alcohol use disorder is.

I have, uh, usually one to two servings of a vegetable like lettuce or broccoli with thinner."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "John, it's very important that you recognize that some fruits, but especially fruit juice can contain a huge amount of calories. Did you know that a glass of orange juice has almost as many calories as a can of cola?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "No, I didn't know. Um, but doesn't the fruit- food pyramid classify, um, fruit juice as a- a serving?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "You're absolutely right, but keep in mind that the food pyramid is to be used as a guideline only. When it comes to nutrition, we have to have a more personalized approach. So I have a hunch, and that is the excess fruit that you were consuming probably caused your weight rebound. What's your impression?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, this changes quite a bit. I mean, here I'm thinking that my fruit intake is making me healthier and actually it's making me fatter."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Indeed. Let me ask you something, knowing what you know now, how important is it to you to lose the weight by decreasing the amount of juice that you're currently taking in?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Obviously, I need to cut back on the fruit juice. But boy, do I love that OJ."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Oh, I understand. Let me ask you this, on a scale from 0 to 10, 0 meaning that there's no way you can do it, and 10 meaning that you're 100% confident that you can do it, how confident are you that you'll be able to reduce the amount of juice you're currently taking in."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, six or seven."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "All right. So, you're not a zero. So, that tells me that you've got some confidence that this is doable, this is something you certainly can do it. Why are you not a zero?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "I guess it's because I know that I need to do it to lose the weight."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So, you realize, again, that if you decrease the amount of juice you're taking in, you're gonna decrease your weight, you're gonna feel better, and you're gonna impact your po- health positively?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yes."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "But you're also not a 10, and that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success.

John, I get the impression that you want to stay in course with weight reduction. And the best way to do this will be to decrease the amount of juice that you're currently taking in.

So along with contributing to high blood pressure, it can have a big impact on your liver, which you need to keep in mind. So your liver has several different roles in your body. First, it helps process excess fatty acids before they get distributed to the rest of your body. It also helps process alcohol and other drugs. So when you have an excess of alcohol, your liver can't work as efficiently and the fatty acids build up, and over time, your liver won't be able to work as well."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Okay."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay.

So I want- I want to hear much that it might have been a good thing that you got caught at this stage, and you got a chance to do some talking about it and working around some strategies to get it under control so it doesn't control you.

There's also a lot of support groups and classes that you can take where you have other people to go through it with you.

Um, I'm really starting to notice how I feel more sluggish and just not-- My mood is shifted a lot too, which at first, I thought was because it's getting colder outside, um, but I do also think it maybe has some relation to my activity, or lack thereof, and also kind of the foods that I'm eating."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay, so you're feeling some low energy and you know, in the past, when you've been more active and eating differently, you've had more energy?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Right. Yeah. Especially during times when I'm more active is when I noticed the biggest cha-change in energy and mood."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yeah. Tell me more about that, those previous times that you've been active."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah. Um, well, I played sports in college, so that kept me pretty busy, and that was really fun, um, and I just think back now to, as much that I would cram into a 24 -hour period, and like, wonder how I did that, but I think that part of it was because I was so active physically, um, I just had way more energy throughout the day, mentally and physically to, um, you know, go to school full-time and-and still socialize with friends and do all that stuff. Um, so when I think back to like, probably like the peak of my life of when I felt my best physically, mentally it was that time."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "You had energy, and you were like the Energizer Bunny, just keep going and going and going."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah, yeah, exactly. And now it's not so much the same. Um, like when I get home from work, I'm pretty exhausted, uh, it takes a lot for me to want to be physically active when I've spent all day staring at a computer and thinking and working. And so, um, yeah, that's probably been my biggest, uh, issue is like when work ends, going home and not really doing anything. Um, just trying to like unwind by watching Netflix or something else, right?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So your days are just as full now that you're working and a career person, um, and your energy level isn't what it used to be. What-- Do you have any ideas about why that might have shifted?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, well, I think part of it is that when I was in college, it wasn't really an option to go, like, I had to go to practice or I had to do those things because that was, in a sense, my job that was paying for school, um, and now there's not that same commitment to other people or to scholarship money. So that definitely has shifted, um, but I-I do feel like a-an urgency to go it just doesn't seem that like the step that's missing is for me to actually go to a gym or somewhere to be more active. Like, I think I want to it's just the doing it that seems to not happen."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Right. So in the past, it wasn't up to you whether you had the choice to go be physically active. Now it is up to you, and-and you're looking back at the last few years and saying, I wanna do things differently."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Mm-hmm."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I want to be more physically active than I've been."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah, yeah, I think so. Um, that's not to say like, I wanna go run a marathon but I do think that it would help me a lot in terms of just having a better outlook on life, um, and better energy to- if I were to pick up some type of activity."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Great. And you've noticed a mood enhancement effect of exercise."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Mm-hmm."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Tell me more about that. What do you notice specifically about your mood on the days you're physically active?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Just, I'm-I'm just happier and more upbeat and I think that even my outlook is more positive. So like, if I'm sitting in traffic, and I haven't been physically active, I'll probably grumble about it but if I'm sitting in traffic, and I have been, it's like, I just have a different outlook on things and I already feel like I've gotten something accomplished that day. So it just kind of like helps with that ripple effect into my day of like getting more things done."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yeah, you feel more accomplished and-and you feel less irritated by the small stuff."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Great. Well, let me see if I've got this all. You came to Arizona six months ago, you're trying to figure out new rhythms and patterns for yourself. You're looking back at the past few years, and in college, you were real active because you were an athlete, and now it's more up to you about making that choice of physical activity, and you're discovering that, um, not being active has affected your energy level and your mood, and that's something you're looking for more of, both of those things, energy and-and a mood booster."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah. And then also to, um, like I mentioned, I'm not totally happy with my weight, um, and so hoping too that that would have some impact there and-and maybe help me, um, if my activity kind of gets resolved or improves, then my nutrition also, maybe would go along with it and get better."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yeah. Tell me more about your weight concerns. When did you start feeling dissatisfied with your body?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Uh, probably about three, four months ago. Um, yeah, just my clothes started fitting tighter, which wasn't as comfortable, and, um, yeah, just not really super happy with my appearance, which has never really been an issue, um, in my life up until now. I've usually been pretty okay with that, and then in the last three months, I just feel, um, like I've had a lot more of a negative outlook on it."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm. Okay, so it sounds like a sort of a vicious cycle and-and maybe the lacking physical activity has made you feel less confident in yourself. I wonder if that's also a piece of this puzzle since you mentioned that's been a big difference from what was happening in the past."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah, I think- I think the activity piece and then also to like, the foods that I'm eating, I don't think are that great. So that also kind of does the same thing, I think, to my appearance or the way that I viewed myself."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. So you had a pretty strong self-confidence, pretty strong body image all the way up until a few months ago and, um, you're hoping to kind of get back to that place where you feel good about yourself."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Mm-hmm. Yeah."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Great."}], "issue": "The patient is seeing the therapist because he or she is dissatisfied with their weight, energy levels, and mood, and wants to make changes to their diet and physical activity."}, {"id": "36_0", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Yes.

It's more of like a little tipsy kind of thing."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm."}, {"from": "human", "value": "I have gotten blackout drunk before-"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm."}, {"from": "human", "value": "-but I kind of did that, learned my lesson, didn't like it."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Got it. So you've-you've had some pretty heavy drinking. What-what do you think is the most you've ever had?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Like how many drinks?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yeah."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, it was a good amount. It was the first time I ever drank and it was like three or four cups, but it was mixing different things."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay, so you don't even know."}, {"from": "human", "value": "So, I'm not-- Yeah."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. So, and then your friends drink too?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah. Yes. Not all of them, but some of them do."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. And how much do they typically drink?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "More or less the same amount. So right now the most we'll have is maybe like one cup after that one time, but sometimes one or two, but they can be kind of heavy."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay, so it's one cup, but it's not-not one drink."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Oh, it's a red, you know, typical. Yeah."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "It has a lot of alcohol in it."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Mm-hmm."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. Um, so gosh, you're-you're actually really drinking quite a lot. Um, you know, your level of drinking puts you in what we call a high-risk group."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Mm-hmm."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So, is that surprising to you?"}], "issue": "The patient is seeing the therapist for unknown reasons as they have not disclosed any issues or concerns."}, {"id": "44_90", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "A little bit."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yeah. Um, so we call it high-risk because it means that there's actually quite a bit of chances that you're gonna have some bad consequences from drinking like that. So, you know, things like, um, having car accidents, or other accidents, or getting in fights, or, you know, sexual assault, or health problems, or developing alcoholism. Have you thought about those things?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Not too much, to be honest. I-I've always thought since it's, you know, within my small group of friends-"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Uh-huh."}, {"from": "human", "value": "-and we usually sleep over each other's house, we don't get into the problems of drinking and driving, and possibly sexual assaults and things like that."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Uh-huh."}, {"from": "human", "value": "But I haven't really thought about possible alcoholism or anything."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. So it's, um, so it's good, because you're not drinking and driving, but you're still really drinking a lot. Um, and yeah. Okay. So, let's-let's talk a little bit about that, how you might be able to make some changes. Because I think you really need to- need to stop drinking like this."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Okay."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So, um, do you think you could quit drinking or?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah, I think I could. I don't need it. For instance, it-it is-- it is used as a kind of, like, let's get the party going."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Uh-huh."}, {"from": "human", "value": "But we haven't always had it-"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Uh-huh."}, {"from": "human", "value": "-obviously. So, I think it would be possible to stop drinking."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. So, does that mean you're gonna stop drinking?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, I would probably start off by like, because my friends are also involved, so I'd be like, \"Hey, guys, I don't think I'm gonna drink today.\""}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Uh-huh."}, {"from": "human", "value": "And kind of see how that goes. Because\u2014"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. Um, you don't sound very much like you think that's gonna work."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah. It's, you know, it's one thing to control my own drinking, and it's another thing when everyone else around me is drinking and then there's like that pressure-"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm."}, {"from": "human", "value": "-of, \"Oh, they're gonna think I look stupid.\""}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. So, how are you gonna quit drinking without your friends thinking you look stupid?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. Um, so I mean, do you think they're really good friends of yours if they're gonna give you such a hard time?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "My close ones, I know they wouldn't be, you know, have a problem with that. But the ones that I'm not that close with, but I'll still like hang out with-"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Uh-huh."}, {"from": "human", "value": "-those are probably the ones that like might ostracize me for something or."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "It sounds like you might be better off without them though. They\u2019re-"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "- maybe not very good friends."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Probably, might be too judgmental."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm. So, um, so I think we should set a goal that you're gonna stop drinking."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Okay."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "And, um, I think you should probably stop as soon as possible, like this weekend."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Okay."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Um, so the way this normally works is, you know, we set you a goal, and then I'll have you come back and we'll talk about it again in a couple of weeks and make sure that you actually stopped. Um, and so what do you think about that?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, I think-- I think the possibility."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. So-"}, {"from": "human", "value": "I think if you make a good plan, like I think I'd be able to follow through with it."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay, great. So, the plan is gonna be that you're gonna quit and, um, the friends that you have that you don't think are supportive, you're just gonna, I guess, not hang out with anymore."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah. I think I can do that."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. And then, um, you know, like, are your friends in band drinking?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, not-not really. The ones that drink more are the ones like my class friends. My band friends, we\u2019re focused on band-"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Uh-huh."}, {"from": "human", "value": "-so I can't really\u2014"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. So, that might be good, is really just to focus more on band. Um, because you know, the other big concern I have for you is if you wanna go to medical school, you're not ever gonna get into medical school if you're drinking like this."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "You know, like college is gonna be really hard. And especially with all those pre-med classes, you're not gonna be able to handle it drinking this much. You know, have you thought about that?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Not too much, to be honest."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yeah. Okay. So, setting this goal then of quitting drinking is gonna be really helpful for you. And um, it sounds like i-it shouldn't be that tough really, um, especially because you can just stop hanging out with-"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Mm-hmm."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "-the people who drink a lot, um, since you have some other friends. Um, yeah. So, do you have any questions for me or?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, what should I-- uh, yeah, I do. So what should I say like once, let's say, I hang out with my friends and they're like, \"Hey, why aren't you- why aren't you drinking?\""}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Like how should I go about that situation?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Well, you know, one good option would be to just review with them review with them all the bad things about alcohol.

Does that make sense?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. So, let's take a look. So I see that you have marked that you sometimes use alcohol, and that you have used alcohol to relax, feel better about yourself or fit in.

I don't keep track."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. And how often?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, probably about once or twice a month."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay.

How long have you been doing that?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Probably since last October."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So, for about six months. I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "What do I like about it?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yeah."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, I don't know. It's just fun to drink with my friends, like when we're at a party at someone else's house, and we're drinking with other people that we don't know. It tastes good."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. So, it sounds like you feel relaxed and have fun when you're drinking with friends and you like the taste."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Mm-hmm."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. I'm also curious, are there any parts about your alcohol use that you don't like?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, I don't like when I get sick in the mornings 'cause of hangovers and-"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm."}, {"from": "human", "value": "-when I start throwing up, that's not- I don't like that."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Have you ever experienced a-a blackout, like when you've been drinking and you wake up and you don't remember what happened?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "No, but that happened to someone I know, though."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. And have you had any problems related to-to your drinking alcohol, like at home or school or somewhere else?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, one time I missed first period of school 'cause I had a hangover and I was late getting up."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Mm, mom got mad at me 'cause I wouldn't get out of bed and she said she knew I had a hangover."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm. Have you told your mother that you drink with your friends?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "No, but I got grounded for two weeks after that.

I see on the questionnaire that you have not ridden in a car with someone who's been drinking and you haven't driven a car, um, after you've been drinking. Is that correct?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "That's great. And I hope you continue to avoid those things. As your doctor, I want you to know that I'm concerned about your drinking. When teens drink, things can go wrong, like injuring yourself. Even when you don't drink too excess, though, your brain is still developing and is very sensitive to the effects of alcohol."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Okay."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "That's why I recommend that all my adolescent patients not drink at all. So if you were thinking today about how ready you feel to stop drinking alcohol on a scale of zero to ten, with zero not being ready at all and ten feeling very ready, what number would you pick?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, probably a five."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "A five? So, I'm curious. Why didn't you pick a lower number like a two or three that would mean you're only a little bit ready to stop drinking?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, I guess I'm just tired of getting in trouble."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. What could you do to avoid getting into trouble?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, not drink."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[chuckles] Have you ever tried not drinking or stopping drinking?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "No, not really."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. What some people your age do is try stopping drinking for a period of time just to see what that feels like."}, {"from": "human", "value": "I could probably do that."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So, how long do you think you could go without drinking?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "I don't know."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Do you think you could go two months without drinking?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah, probably."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. What things would make it easier for you to not drink?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, I could probably drink something else when my friends are drinking, like just coke."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Anything else to make things easier for you?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "I can probably hang out with some of my friends who don't drink or inviting them to parties and having fun 'cause not everyone drinks at parties."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. Is there anybody in your life that you can talk to about this, who give you some support for not drinking?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah. The-- My friends who don't drink would probably be happy that I'm not drinking either and yes, they'd support me."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Great. So you've come up with some reasons to stop drinking, like having hangovers and throwing up and getting into trouble. And you've developed some strategies to-to try to not drink, like spending more time with friends who don't drink or having non-alcoholic drinks when people around you are drinking alcohol. I think that's a great plan. I'm really proud of you for giving this a try.

If it's all hands-on though, it would be all good."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yeah. So, there's something here about your level of-- about how confident you are around writing or how unconfident you are, that sounds like it's getting in the way."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah. No, it does get in the way. I just don't wanna do it."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm. Okay."}, {"from": "human", "value": "It's a waste of time."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "All right. So, it sounds like we might need to have some more conversation around that."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So, what's really getting in the way?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "For what?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Well, this writing business.

I can't."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "-so I'm wondering where you are around your writing and you're reading?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Oh, it's pretty [unintelligible 00:23:47], but, like, still-- I don't know, I'm not retarded, or anything.

But when the skin's burned off your arm, you literally react to it. Her lungs are exquisitely sensitive. Uh, and like the skin on your arm would be if the skin got burned off.

So, what would that look like for you?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Mm, um, you know, I-I guess drinking no more than maybe three or four times a week, and-and on the weekends, which is when I would drink the most, cup back to no more than five or six beers."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay, okay. Well, sometimes when people aren't ready to make changes like this, it helps if they write down their goals, it gives them a chance to see them in black and white. If you were to look at this little form here and figure out where you want to go with your drinking, what would you put down as your goal?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, doing the math, I guess no more than 18 drinks a week."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. So that's an improvement. So you're headed in the right direction. I do wanna let you know that with 18 drinks a week, you're still falling above this low-level risk category, and that it would be my recommendation that at some point you would fall below into this 14 or less a week.

What do you think of a idea like that?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Hmm. That's, that's interesting. I-I never really thought of something like that, but, yeah, it might work."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. Okay, I'm glad you think so. Um, so, other than this neighbor, or is there anyone else that could help you?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Hmm. No, I-- you know, there-there just aren't that many people I trust right now with my son."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay, I can respect that. You-you really have to go with kind of your gut and follow your own intuition on that. Um, what about the baby's father, is he of any help?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "[chuckles] No, no, not at all. He, he really hasn't been in the picture since my son was born."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay, fine. You know what? We've got one really good lead with the neighbor. I think if you would follow up in pursuing that, you might find some relief and resolve some of your childcare issues. Um, how many days a week are you in school?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "It's-it's three nights right now, so I have class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. Um, so what would it look like if you had a plan where both your neighbor and your mom were helping you out?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, well, you know, if my neighbor could even just take over one day of watching my son, I think that would help my mom quite a bit."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, if you could just reduce the amount of time that you're needing your mom, she might be more supportive, more onboard?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "I mean, I think so, yeah."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "All right. Um, so what do you think would be your next steps in working out a plan between your neighbor and your mom?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Mom, you know, just, I guess talking to my neighbor and seeing if she's even interested in this idea, and if she is, you know, telling my mom about it and, you know, hopefully, that will make her feel a little better and maybe a little bit more reliable."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. Sounds like you got a good plan to follow up on there. All right. Um, now you mentioned that your son is two. When will he turn three?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Just a couple months from now. He's almost three."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. Well, in that I-- in that case, I've got another idea for you. Um, what about, um, maybe when he turns three, you could enroll him in Head Start? Are you familiar with that program?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "I've heard of it, but I don't know that much."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. Head Start is a very affordable, very high-quality preschool program. Um, it was really created for parents and families, just like yours, folks who have a lower income and fewer resources, but Head Start really prepares your child both socially and intellectually for going to school. Um, and you know, by the time he turns three, you may find that that routine is something that's better for him to get used to before he starts kindergarten. Uh, would you like some more information on local Head Start sites?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it would be really good for my son and, you know, it would help me out in terms of childcare for sure."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. Well, good. Um, all right. It sounds like you've got a good plan there going forward. Um, now I did see from the nurse practitioner's notes, you're also working on reducing your smoking and your drinking. How's that going?"}], "issue": "the baby was born.

So, I mean, I've done okay some days, but others, not so much."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. So what I hear you say is that it was a bigger challenge than you expected, yeah, but you're working on it. You're-you're still committed to it. So yeah, that's really to be commended. I just want to ask you one thing though. Have you thought about secondhand smoke and the dangers of that and how that might be impacting your son?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah, yeah. I definitely have, so I-I try to never smoke around him, and if I do smoke at home, I always go out to the balcony to smoke."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Oh, okay, good. You know, I can tell you really have your son's best interest at heart here. You know, just from our conversation today, I can tell you're a really good mom. Um, let's reflect back on what we've discussed here so far. Now, we've got a couple of good options between the neighbor and Head Start programs for childcare. What do you see as your next steps in getting that going?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um, well, I guess just first talk to my neighbor and see if she likes this idea, and then if she does, I can talk to my mom about it. Hopefully, that kind of helps her situation out. And then, um, I'm definitely want to look into the Head Start idea because I think that would be really good."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay, okay. Good. Um, I think you've got a good plan there. Um, what would you say to us getting back together, say, in two weeks, just for us to kind of revisit and see what kind of progress you've made, you know, if you've got something worked out, great, but if you've hit a bump in the road, I tell you what, we'll put our heads together. We'll come up with another plan."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Okay."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "All right. Good. Well, I want to thank you again for coming in today, Sarah.

It's some damage to the roof of your mouth that happens from tobacco smoking and so I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit how-- about how tobacco fits in your life right now."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Tobacco. Well, I don't smoke cigarettes. I've never smoked cigarettes. I do go out with my friends. Um, you know, we go out to bars and, you know, we'll have a few drinks and smoke some of those little cigarillo-type things. I mean I wouldn't even think of them as cigars and they're certainly not cigarettes. Um, and I mean I'll have one or two of those in an evening with, uh, with my friends but certainly not 20 or 30 of them a day like you would with cigarettes and that's the only thing that could possibly have anything to do with tobacco."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So you've made a decision in your life not to smoke cigarettes, that's something you didn't want to do. It sounds like you're kinda concerned about the health effects of cigarettes. But you have been smoking the little cigarillos at least one or two every time you go out."}, {"from": "human", "value": "But that's- that's just like a- a social thing. That's something that my friends and I do. We-- We-- It's not habit or something that I have to have and, you know, talking about one or two when we go out for an evening. Not packs of them."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yeah, so you're not-- You're not like those chain smokers, you're not smoking packs and packs a day."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Oh, no. No."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "The amount you smoke is so miniscule you can't even imagine that it would cause any harm and yet here it is damaging the roof of your mouth."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, we've-- you have a point there. Mm, now that you mention it, um, I have started having one or two at work, you know, when we have break since I have a couple of friends at work that smoke and so every time we have a break, you know, we all go out to the- the break place outside, um, and so I- now I go with them and I have one of these Swisher Sweets. Um, I like the peach flavor [unintelligible 00:02:32] they're so cute. But that's really only pretty recently."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Uh-huh. So smoking has kind of become a big part of your social life now. When you go out, you're smoking, and even during breaks at work, you're smoking."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, yeah, yeah. You know now that you say it like that it's true. Um, I am smoking on a daily basis."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So aside from that social aspect, what are the things you like about it?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, it's relaxing and it's just nice to be with people, um. Um, and you know, when, you know, I like to go to Las Vegas, and so when we go to Vegas, it's really fun to go to the cigar bars, is kind of sophisticated and fun and so, you know, it's mostly a social thing."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay."}, {"from": "human", "value": "I wouldn't say I was a chain smoker."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. How about the other side? Have you noticed any not-so-good things about the smoking?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, I was going to ask you about, um, whitening my teeth because I've noticed that they have more stains on them up than a few years ago, and so I imagine that has something to do with the smoking."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yeah. So we're noticing some pretty negative effects in terms of your oral health with the smoking. Are there any other things that you're concerned about?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Um. Well, there's the expense, you know. Wi-with the economy and all, um, I- I have to be careful about my money and so, um, there is the extra expense of if I'm buying more of them than I used to. So the-the money aspect is also a concern."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm. So there's your oral health, there's the financial aspect, and then e-earlier you brought up some concerns about smoking cigarettes and how that can be harmful for you."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Oh, yeah."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Were you aware of the fact that smoking these little cigarillos, the Swisher Sweets, can have some of the same negative health effects?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Oh, absolutely not. I mean I thought of it more as a- a fun thing to do with my friends, certainly not a smoking habit or anything that would be harmful."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm.

I checked the box on your form when you asked if I use tobacco, I checked \"No,\" because I never thought of myself as a smoker."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm. What do you kind of make of that now that you realize that you're actually a tobacco user and that you might actually be causing some pretty se-serious health effects."}, {"from": "human", "value": "I'm really concerned, I mean, I don't want to, um, develop cancer, lung cancer, or any of the awful things that happen from smoking, and, you know, really, until this conversation, I never really thought of myself as a smoker at all. So-"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm."}, {"from": "human", "value": "-I'm very concerned."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Well, the good news is in terms of the nicotinic stomatitis, at the point in which you stop smoking, you can actually reverse all the negative effects that occurred and you might also know that you can stop the progression of any other diseases that had started, just by quitting smoking."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Really?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yeah. Is that something you'd be interested in?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Oh, I would. I really would because, like I said, I'm a brand new smoker. I didn't know I was a smoker until I came to see you."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm. Well, if you think about it on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is really don't think you could do it at all and 10 is really confident that you could quit if you tried, where do you think you fall?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Oh, I think I will probably be in seven or eight. I'm-I'm pretty confident that I could stop doing this."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay, what made you choose seven or eight as opposed to a-a five?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Because it's not a part of my daily life. I don't have to have, uh, a smoke when I get up in the morning. I don't smoke 20 or 30 of them a day, so it's not that much exposure and I-I feel pretty confident that I could stop."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm. So, it sounds like just to kind of summarize, you've noticed some negative effects of the smoking, you have some concerns about health effects that could occur, there's the financial aspect, and yet you feel pretty confident that you could quit if you tried.

And she, kind of, knew what I was doing. She asked me to, like, to promise her of no alcohol, no drugs. Then I'll pick you up by 12:00. And I-I was surprised. 12:00-12:00, that's basically when the party starts, but I told her whatever-- I thought- I thought to myself that I'll-I'll come-- I'll figure out to delay her, can you pick me up later? So later, so she-- I promised that-- She dropped me off, I promised her no alcohol, no nothing. So I-- we go, I have fun like I've been having. And I was drinking. And then the time- the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon-- I couldn't delay her from picking me up. And as soon as she picked me up, and I stepped in the car, she said, \"You drank vodka.\" And I'm like, I-I didn't know what to say. I just looked at the floor.

What do you like about drinking?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "I don't know. It-It's because I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not when- not when I'm dealing with sports or like-- you know, like a social environment.

Tell me what else is good about it."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Hmm, I like to have a cigarette after I eat. It sort of tells my brain I'm finished, stop eating, I'm full.

I feel like I'm being a bad parent, and um, I often wonder, you know, they've seen me smoke for years.

I appreciate that this is a- this is a tough topic. This is a-a hard behavior to think about giving up. Um, I guess one thing that- one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that, you know, on the one hand, you talk about how being a good parent is your highest priority, it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter-"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Mm-hmm."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "-um, and on the other hand, I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief, socializing, and it's something you can't imagine ever changing.

Um, we have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing, who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do, and one of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change, why you would even consider quitting smoking. And then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about, as well as some of the less good things about quitting and about continuing to smoke.

And the nice thing is that it will get better with paracetamol and fluids, and the paracetamol will help the pain. Um, with giving it to the kids, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about that.

Well, something I could talk about in the interview too. You know, even if I was some type of certification where I could say, I could, you know, with confidence talk about- about that."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm. Okay. What-- do you have any ideas as to what fields you might be interested in getting some more education, more training?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "I mean, I guess, I just don't really know what it's gonna be because I need to have a job now so I'm not really sure."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Like what's going to be fastest."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Right. I almost feel like that's more important than what I'm interested in, you know, because I'm like, I'm not going to go back to school for four years right now."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay, and so if- if you were, it sounds like if you were going to do something you'd wanna to do something really quickly like a short- a short certificate."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah or something-- yeah, something that I could get immediate skills that would, you know, get me into some kind of a job now, even if it's not my long-term goal or, you know, career just- just get me into something and then I can always focus on."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yeah, sort of like a short-term or transition into something else."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah. Great. Exactly."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "But that would be steady and pays well?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Mm-hmm."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay, and allow you to afford everything you need to afford."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah, because even those jobs right now don't feel accessible for me.

Okay.

I'll just take it easy for a couple of days."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Well, since I have you here and we still have a few minutes left, I'd like to bring up another topic. I noticed that your blood pressure and your weight have been climbing a bit over the past few years. We haven't really had time to talk about this much before and I may be able to offer some useful strategies. Would it be okay if we discussed weight and health for a few minutes?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah, I suppose. I know my weight is a problem, but every time I try to take it off, I end up gaining it back. I don't know what to do."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I know how you feel. Managing weight can be frustrating. Maybe we can just start trying to figure it out together and I'll be here to help you through the challenges."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Okay, thank you doctor, but I'm just concerned about how I can possibly lose weight now since work is so busy and the kids take up so much of my time."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yeah, that's certainly understandable. We both know that there's a lot that plays into weight management, but there's no need to figure it all out today, especially since things are so busy for you right now. Maybe we could put our heads together and think about something small that fits reasonably into your life and then we can take further steps when you're ready."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Okay, that sounds great. So, what should I do?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Well, let's see. One of the things that's involved in managing weight and health is being active. Physical activity benefits the whole body. It's healthy for our joints, our stress levels, and especially for weight management. Perhaps we could talk about some ways of adding activity that fit into your life."}, {"from": "human", "value": "I knew you were gonna say that, but I don't have time in my schedule. I can't afford to take an hour to go to the gym every day."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Well, I understand that. I don't have an hour to go to the gym every day either, but one of the great things about physical activity is that any amount in any type of activity can be very helpful. For example, let's think about some activities that you enjoy doing."}, {"from": "human", "value": "I like to walk."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Me too. Walking is great exercise."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Wait a minute, isn't walking too mild to help you lose weight, though?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Actually, even just a few minutes of walking is really healthy and worthwhile, and then when you have time to do even more, that's great. Walking is also great because you can do it anywhere, it doesn't need to be at the gym."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Oh, wow, that sounds good. You know what? Come to think of it, I have some time before I have to go back to work and I saw a nice park on the way over here, maybe I can take a short walk after this appointment."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "That sounds great."}, {"from": "human", "value": "And you know what? I used to really love to dance, but I haven't done that in such a long time."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Well, dancing is a great exercise, especially because it's fun."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Hmm. And I know my family would support me if I could just find some place where I can go dancing."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Oh, that's great to hear that your family is so supportive. And I bet there's a dance class somewhere around where you live or maybe even a dance fitness class at the gym."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah, and you know what? I really like to try that."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Would you like to do some research on this and give it a shot?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Actually, I really would. I'm kind of excited about it. What else you got?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Well, small steps can go a long way. So, even things like taking the stairs instead of the elevator every once in a while or parking just a bit further from the door when you go to a store can be ways to increase movement in your day."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Mm-hmm. I can do that."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "How about we start there and let's plan to follow up in a few weeks so we can see how it's going and then maybe talk about some other strategies that might help."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Diet, the D word."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Not necessarily. What we eat is certainly important for weight and health, but just like we did today, we can talk about some small steps that can fit into your life, and especially ones that you feel good about."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah, I like that. Okay, I'll make an appointment and I'll start dancing right away, doc."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "That's great.

Well, as I said, there's a lot of irritation, in particular, like I was mentioning, up here in the roof of your mouth, it's turned really definitely white-colored and there's little red spots. And you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth, but you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth, which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health. It's called nicotinic stomatitis. And this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco. So, maybe you're not smoking cigarettes, are you smoking a pipe or cigars? Or is there something else that could be contributing to this? Because I don't know what else might be causing it."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, the only thing-- I've never smoked cigarettes ever, um, but, um, when, um, when I go out with my friends, um, we like to go to, you know, we like to go out to lounges."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Mm-hmm."}, {"from": "human", "value": "And, um, you know, sometimes they're those- those, uh, nice young men that gift you different sorts of things. And we got some of those mini cigars that are Swisher sweets, they come in peach and-and grape and-and, you know, that's the only time that really, you know, I've ever really used anything that-that's got tobacco in it."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay, so I think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit-flavored, people think they're okay. Those are really bad for you. Did you know that?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Really? Bad? But they're just little, mini, little, cute little girly cigars."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Right. They're still cigars and they're still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarette, so it's really important."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, I only use them just to relax. I mean, it's not like it's something that I would smoke 20 or 30 cigarettes a day, I mean, I only do it when we go out."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Uh-huh. Well, that's, I mean, at least you're not doing that, so that's good, but it's still causing a lot of problems. And as I said, I can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth, you're causing some serious damage, and this needs to stop. Have you thought about quitting?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, I didn't really know I'd started."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "What do you mean?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "I didn't really think that it was anything more than just like social drinking, just something that I do in a social setting when me and my friends go out to the bars."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So you're gonna quit then?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Uh, maybe."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "What do you mean, maybe? I just told you how bad it is for you. It's messing up your mouth, you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases. This is really important. You need to quit."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, it's something that I'll have to think about."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "What's there to think about? [chuckles] You said it's not that something you do all that often, and there's all these negative side effects, there's all these risks that you're putting yourself in."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, it's just something that I do to relax, and I don't do it that often. And so I probably could cut back."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay, well, that's a good start, but cutting back isn't going to do it.

At one point in the night, though, they all went out to have a cigarette and I joined them.

And I-I don't want to be- expose him to it, so I've been avoiding him when I smoke."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "All right, Well, first I'd just like to commend you for your honesty and that's really helpful information that you shared with me. Thank you for letting me know that you're smoking again and-and, um, I also appreciate the fact you're taking so many measures to protect your son from secondhand smoke. Can I give you some advice on how you could protect him, even the- even further?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah, sure."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So, my sense is that you're smoking and you're minimizing hi-his exposure by not smoking in the same room and smoking near windows. Is that-"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "-correct?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Exactly."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So what I would recommend then, is to move your smoking outside completely. As a smoker, the ideal situation for a smoker in the house is if their home can be made smoke-free and the smoking is moved entirely outside, especially while he's experiencing this cold."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah, well, you know that sounds okay. While he's sick, I might be able to smoke outside in the next couple days or so, but the thing is, usually I'm craving a cigarette the most when I have a glass of wine at the end of the day. I put Jake to bed, I open up a bottle and I pour myself a glass and I'm finally able to unwind, so, I get a craving for a cigarette, so, I'm not sure long-term I'd be able to smoke outside."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay, so, what I'm hearing you say is that, it sounds like a feasible short-term plan, not ideal and not comfortable because what you really enjoy is that cigarette with a glass of wine, kicking back up on the sofa and chilling out perhaps while you're watching TV. And to maintain that long-term outside smoking outside in Canadian winters where it's cold and snowy, not realistic."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah, exactly and another thing is that sometimes in the morning, after I've had a couple of glasses of wine, I kinda feel tired or groggy or low on energy, so, even that I'm not sure is completely relaxing. Especially if I've had a cigarette the night before, I always feel so bad."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So, on the one hand I'm hearing smoking and drinking at night as a way to chill out but at the same time the next day, you're not feeling so great."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Exactly."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Would it be helpful to give you some information on low risk drinking guidelines?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Sure. I've never heard of them."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. Well, Hailey, what they suggest is that women don't have more than one to two standard drinks a day or a total of nine standard drinks in a week. How does that fit for you?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, usually I'm having more than two glasses but if you're saying that's gonna minimize some risk and I guess some of the grogginess I'm feeling the next morning, then maybe I should just try and have one glass of wine in the evenings?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So, it sounds like you'd be open to reducing as a way to still enjoy the wine but perhaps alleviate the way you feel in the morning, some of the hangover effects that sounds like you're experiencing."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah, I-I'd absolutely maybe reduce. I'll try my best to reduce, but I'm not sure about the smoking."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. So, you're gonna try to reduce the drinking, not sure about the smoking, what the plan is but I think we did agree upon earlier that you would move it outside, at least while he's sick?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Yeah. I think that sounds okay."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "That's okay. All right and, um, I guess we'll see you next week for Jake's six-month checkup. Is there anything else we could talk about that might be helpful?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "No. I think just talking about it was helpful, you know, and I'm- I'm glad you've given me some information. Maybe just this week I can think about it a little more, you know, I-I feel pretty overwhelmed right now. There's so much to do. My days are pretty full, so, maybe I can just s-sit on it for a week."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Sure, of course, Hailey a-and again I really appreciate your openness and honesty about letting me know what's going on with, you know, the stress levels and coping and drinking. I just had a thought that there's also a good mom's group, we run out of our center. So if you'd like a referral to that or some information, I'd be happy to give you and while you think about it, if you want to, um, talk about this further with one of my colleagues, I'd be happy to make you an appointment."}, {"from": "human", "value": "All right.

No, it- it's just- it's just weird for me. I don't- I don't like thinking about that stuff, yeah."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Sure. I totally appreciate that, and it's your decision, Olivia.

You can keep him hydrated, avoid over-the-counter cold remedies. Keep him away from people who have flu or cold-like symptoms and avoid smoke. And the last one should be easy because you quit smoking during your pregnancy."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, you're right. I-I did quit smoking when I was pregnant, but actually, um, a couple of weeks ago, I went out, my mom was able to take Jake for the night and my friends they were having a birthday party and we had a couple of glasses of wine and it felt like old times. So before I knew it, I was out having a cigarette with them. And since then I've been having a couple of cigarettes a day, you know, just at the end of the day after I put Jake to bed.

And I'd like to spend some time talking about it now."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, I had no idea that it was such a big deal.

You're telling me that Jake can't breathe, you're concerned about his breathing. And then you just slip in the fact that you're smoking cigarettes and you think there's no relationship?

It was just when I went out with my friends and, you know, usually, I'm fine with the cravings. It's just when I have a glass of wine at the end of the day.

You know, I'm doing pretty good."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So it sounds like if you have alcohol, then smoking is very difficult to avoid and you know what you need to do. You need to go home and as your-your son's doctor, I need to tell you you need to go home and throw out those cigarettes. You need to quit."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Okay. Um, well, yeah, I-I guess I can throw the cigarettes. And tomorrow night when I have my glass of wine, I'll-I'll just try to avoid that craving."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "And let's talk some more about wine.

Stopping smoking is not easy but it's possible and with the type of support that we offer here in the pharmacy, you absolutely make your chance of success four times greater than trying on your own, so, that's why it's really good that you've come to see me.

I suppose a big bowl of soup would be far better than two pies."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yeah. Well, a big bowl of vegetable soup. You could probably count that as one or maybe even two of your five a day. So it'd be a really good place to start. Anything else you could think about doing?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Well, there's one, one thing uh, I've done already, I've stopped adding salt to my food. The doc said that would help with my blood pressure."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Well, that's good. That's probably benefited you already.

I'll tell my wife, um, she's still very fond of her salt and her mother had osteoporosis."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So well, maybe you can help her as well and that would be good. Well, I think you've got off to a really great start, Mr. Green. You're very well aware of what you-you need to do, and you've obviously thought about it and got some good plans in place. So you're going to reduce your-your alcohol intake, you've already started by reducing your salt intake. Um, perhaps when we meet up next time we could talk a little bit about smoking and exercise as well, when you're ready for that. So how do you feel now?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "I feel if I go ahead and do as I say with cutting down on the pies, the crisps, um, and cutting out the booze, I feel I'm making a start but let's take it a step at a time and see how it goes.
