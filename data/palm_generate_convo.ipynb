He’s also a writer and is interested in helping produce the book. I made plans to meet him in the shop so I could give him an overview of the project, tell him what’s going on, figure out how we’re going to coordinate who does what because, unlike many of the other people who have volunteered to help with the manual labor, William is the fully-qualified press operator so I don’t need to supervise him. We got there and there was another guy, George, there. George is a newly-initiated brother. He’s an undergrad; William and I are both alums. George had made plans with Jordan and Justin to get trained to use the press. None of us had e-mailed the print shop. Jordan was to actually reserve the press; undergrads get priority. So Jordan and Justin showed up and they trained George to use the press.</td>\n",

George didn’t have a text in mind to print, so I sent a text message to Lucy saying, “You know how you’ve asked before if I could do a broadside of one of your poems? Do you have one in mind? We have a trainee here.” So she sent me a link to a poem that was four times as long as her usual. It was epically – there was no way the trainee was going to be able to do it at all; but I didn’t want to tell her that, so I didn’t. The trainee found something else to print. I think he printed business cards for Justin or something. Meanwhile, while the trainee was being trained, William and I worked on setting type, since we didn’t have paper and we couldn’t print anyway. We were able to set type. We set like 2½ pages over the course of Saturday and Sunday between the two of us. The setting of the type went a lot slower than I remember it going on previous projects.

I went back on Sunday and worked in the print shop, then I stared at Lucy’s poem for several hours at work on Monday trying to figure out how to make it fit on a single sheet of paper because it wouldn’t fit in just one column long ways, but breaking it into three columns and doing it in landscape instead of portrait, it did work – at least in my digital mock-up. I went to the print shop last night after work and work was just distressing for a lot of reasons. Then there were distressing conversations on Twitter and – I don’t know – I was just in a bad mood, in general, when I got to the shop. I got to the shop later than I wanted to. I got there at 9:00 and I had intended to get there at 7:30. I started setting type and I realized I don’t have enough Garamonds to set Lucy’s poem. I wanted to do her poem in Garamond, I would have to do it in three blocks, like set a third of the poem, print a third of the poem, put the type away, lather, rinse, repeat. I really didn’t want to do that because it would just massively increase the amount of time everything takes. So I went digging through the shop and the only font we have in 10-point, or we have enough of, is Century Schoolbook, which is wider than Garamond. I got about 1/3 of the way through setting it when I realized that my layout wasn’t going to work. I didn’t have my laptop with me, so</td>\n",

I think I've always been wary of accepting other people's stories about me, because I've been afraid that they would define who I am. I want to be my own person, and I don't want to be controlled by anyone else's expectations.   \n",

I think that's one of the things that I'm trying to do in therapy: to be more open to hearing what other people have to say, and to be less defensive about my own beliefs.   \n",

On the one hand, Wednesday was very difficult, and yesterday was productive and better. So I think both in terms of my sort of response to distress, I guess, and in terms of... oh, I don't know. I'm not... I mean, I'm finding myself at a bit of a loss for words, I guess, unusually. I don't know what to make of this process. I don't really know how to evaluate where I am in it. And I think the way... my fear right now is that the issues involved are very simple and that, even meeting as often as we do, we're actually making it more complex. I guess that's my fear.   \n",

Just, you know, being perfectly frank about it... I'm trying to evaluate at this moment. The... to the extent that the things that are problematic are very straightforward... in other words the deficits that are kind of the proximal cause for my coming to engage in this process are difficult and very disruptive but concrete. I just... I can't... I'm finding it hard to evaluate how much the narrative... our narrative is helping. And I can see some ways in which it's actually making it more complex to resolve.   \n",

So I don't know. I mean, the other alternative scenario is that it's just part of the process, that it's just very hard. And I definitely accept the possibility that... [the chief] (ph) transference. And this is yet one more recrudescence of this pattern, in which case sticking with it rather than aborting would be desirable. So that's kind of where I am with it.   \n",

When friends find out or I email friends, it all seems very quick and sudden. And in the moral world of dating and engagement, the non-religious world, it seems like it’s more typical to have honor for your separation and give it a try. I clearly just don’t want to be too hasty; but at the same time, I feel a lot of resolve for where I’m at and it feels a little bit like where I was at with the church, finishing up the paperwork to remove my records. It’s just kind of an additional chore that I don’t want to think about, but it was over in my mind already.   \n",

I think most people can. I think that’s why it’s a little disturbing. With the protagonist, he’s talking about how there is this façade that people seem to interact with, but that’s not him. And then there is a scene in the movie where he’s breaking up with his long-time girlfriend and she’s like, “What about all of our friends?” and he’s like, “You can have them. You can have them all.” [00:05:12] (laughs) I feel like that’s basically what happened, except there was no   \n",

I've noticed that I've been doing things like not doing things that my partner asks me to do, and I've been feeling a lot of resentment towards them.  I think this is because I'm feeling like they're not meeting my needs, and I'm not sure how to communicate that to them.   \n",

There is a long, long stupid story about the print shop. I don’t know that it’s necessarily or important, but I haven’t been thinking about anything except the print shop for the last many days. This book I’m trying to print, I don’t have paper for it yet, which is deeply irritating and distressing.   \n",

I had plans with a guy named William. He’s a member of my fraternity. He’s also a writer and is interested in helping produce the book. I made plans to meet him in the shop so I could give him an overview of the project, tell him what’s going on, figure out how we’re going to coordinate who does what because, unlike many of the other people who have volunteered to help with the manual labor, William is the fully-qualified press operator so I don’t need to supervise him. We got there and there was another guy, George, there. George is a newly-initiated brother. He’s an undergrad; William and I are both alums. George had made plans with Jordan and Justin to get trained to use the press. None of us had e-mailed the print shop. Jordan was to actually reserve the press; undergrads get priority. So Jordan and Justin showed up and they trained George to use the press.   \n",

There is someone there; they’re just not visible. George didn’t have a text in mind to print, so I sent a text message to Lucy saying, “You know how you’ve asked before if I could do a broadside of one of your poems? Do you have one in mind? We have a trainee here.” So she sent me a link to a poem that was four times as long as her usual. It was epically – there was no way the trainee was going to be able to do it at all; but I didn’t want to tell her that, so I didn’t. The trainee found something else to print. I think he printed business cards for Justin or something. Meanwhile, while the trainee was being trained, William and I worked on setting type, since we didn’t have paper and we couldn’t print anyway. We were able to set type. We set like 2½ pages over the course of Saturday and Sunday between the two of us. The setting of the type went a lot slower than I remember it going on previous projects. I don’t know if it’s just that I’m out of practice or it was challenging with multiple people in the shop to move at peak efficiency. I don’t know what was going on.   \n",
       "21   Yeah, it was really frustrating.  I went back on Sunday and worked in the print shop, then I stared at Lucy’s poem for several hours at work on Monday trying to figure out how to make it fit on a single sheet of paper because it wouldn’t fit in just one column long ways, but breaking it into three columns and doing it in landscape instead of portrait, it did work – at least in my digital mock-up. I went to the print shop last night after work and work was just distressing for a lot of reasons. Then there were distressing conversations on Twitter and – I don’t know – I was just in a bad mood, in general, when I got to the shop. I got to the shop later than I wanted to. I got there at 9:00 and I had intended to get there at 7:30. I started setting type and I realized I don’t have enough Garamonds to set Lucy’s poem. I wanted to do her poem in Garamond, I would have to do it in three blocks, like set a third of the poem, print a third of the poem, put the type away, lather, rinse, repeat. I really didn’t want to do that because it would just massively increase the amount of time everything takes. So I went digging through the shop and the only font we have in 10-point, or we have enough of, is Century Schoolbook, which is wider than Garamond. I got about 1/3 of the way through setting it when I realized that my layout wasn’t going to work. I didn’t have my laptop with me, so   \n",

We're supposed to come up with a spreadsheet to detail how much area we're going to need. But Brian refuses to store the spreadsheet on a network file drive or SharePoint. He sends me copies to work with infrequently, and then we work in parallel. Then I send him my work, and he's like, \"Well, this is out of date because I was working while you were working.\" It's really frustrating. I can't get any traction.   \n",

And certainly part of it was, in spite of knowing intellectually, that he was really depressed and miserable, and has been for quite awhile, he fakes being okay really well.\\nSo when we were on dates, he would pretend everything was normal, and he didn’t talk about his depression the way all of my other friends did.   \n",

It’s important to focus on what you can control and let go of what you can’t.  It sounds like you’ve already tried talking to your boss about your concerns. If that didn’t work, you could try talking to your HR department or another trusted adult.  You could also start looking for a new job. It’s important to remember that you have options. You don’t have to stay in a situation that makes you unhappy.   \n",
