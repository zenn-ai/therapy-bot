He’s also a writer and is interested in helping produce the book. I made plans to meet him in the shop so I could give him an overview of the project, tell him what’s going on, figure out how we’re going to coordinate who does what because, unlike many of the other people who have volunteered to help with the manual labor, William is the fully-qualified press operator so I don’t need to supervise him. We got there and there was another guy, George, there. George is a newly-initiated brother. He’s an undergrad; William and I are both alums.

We set like 2½ pages over the course of Saturday and Sunday between the two of us. The setting of the type went a lot slower than I remember it going on previous projects.

50,"Yeah, it was really frustrating.  I went back on Sunday and worked in the print shop, then I stared at Lucy’s poem for several hours at work on Monday trying to figure out how to make it fit on a single sheet of paper because it wouldn’t fit in just one column long ways, but breaking it into three columns and doing it in landscape instead of portrait, it did work – at least in my digital mock-up. I went to the print shop last night after work and work was just distressing for a lot of reasons. Then there were distressing conversations on Twitter and – I don’t know – I was just in a bad mood, in general, when I got to the shop. I got to the shop later than I wanted to. I got there at 9:00 and I had intended to get there at 7:30. I started setting type and I realized I don’t have enough Garamonds to set Lucy’s poem. I wanted to do her poem in Garamond, I would have to do it in three blocks, like set a third of the poem, print a third of the poem, put the type away, lather, rinse, repeat. I really didn’t want to do that because it would just massively increase the amount of time everything takes. So I went digging through the shop and the only font we have in 10-point, or we have enough of, is Century Schoolbook, which is wider than Garamond. I got about 1/3 of the way through setting it when I realized that my layout wasn’t going to work. I didn’t have my laptop with me, so",,"Client _B_, Session March 13, 2014_ Client discusses challenges with work trainings and printings. _ Alexander Street, part of Clarivate"
